just despise the folks because im broke and white its absurd im told be tight you get heard but i dont hear my vinyl spinning yeah we found some distribution but bet the crying is just beginning cause these bright nights could lead to dark days and vice versa even if greg street dont play i guarantee you a nice purchase frankly im quite certain im the livest fucker out there im making love to the truth inside that vocal booth without care i wont even talk about stares from angry illogic rappers cause every time they get confronted theyll give you head than dap ya this one dont really need a hook but shannon said itll be a single so i devote this to my life so much more than a catch of a jiggle dark days bright nights for that outside in the night you know what bubbas life is like bright nights dark days for them broads that truly love me and hate to see me live this way dark days bright nights for when they say you cant live fuck em do it just out of spite bright nights dark days for every person without a voice that got something they need to say see its imperative that you know theres a lot of folks that love bubba not cause of any rap i wrote they see something above gutter though my pockets dont reflect that its my vision and they respect that love comes in a form of a various drug and i cant neglect that so me and my folks get fucked up like six nights out of seven thats the bright light of our lives like gods shinning light right out of heaven but at the conclusion of every session i wish that dark day to expose the plight of my situation no blow no dough for big shows but still they see we this close from seeing the promise land so that leads to another bright night when all of us is college grads being loved by the moms and dads which some of us wasnt blessed with you think we all born with two lovin parents and a treasure chest shit i was fortunate to be loved by my paternal units im gonna make their son a winner fuck how bad itll hurt im doing it even if i was to ruin it never with me and my heart part ways we developed too strong of a bond turning bright nights into dark days yeah its true i also do get praise from the other side of the tracks you know that dark days part of town when they intentionally hide the blacks aint got no reply to that i said im sorry if im to blame i tried like hell to sooth your soul by planting the facts inside your brain i never once lied to the game the acceptance of not one black dude its just bubba that country fucker smoking swages and eating snack foods now every time they ask you why you live the way you choose too say cause bubba set you right the only one they loved knew you that leaves you with no excuse to settle with what they offer he try to pay you the slave wagers play that role and tell em naw sir ill probably wont even fault you dismiss me as the demon it is true i am not you my skins the tone of piss and semen but if we fight this evening i assure you well both bleed red and itll take your whole slum and all your guns to leave me dead plus all that blood we shed what do nothin but server their purpose so lets unite these bright nights and dark days then see who

to waste its running out of runway well touch the clouds one day until that day i wait cause i love how this sand tastes with work ill keep my eyes to the sky in a world of mastered lies theres no time to play youll survive all you got to do is try and remember even angels aint too fly to pray so this shouldnt be a surprise just open your eyes to see what i say cause the sun still shines in the hearts of the blind so ill be on my way so if you smoke and drink away the pain and youre trying to change but things just remain the same so if you smoke and drink away the pain face reality again

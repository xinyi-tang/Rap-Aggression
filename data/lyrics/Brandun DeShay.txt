yeah i can take you higher than this wait no i said it aint nothing higher yeah i swear its nothing higher it aint nothing thats higher than this is this a dream or it used to be cause somehow we dont even need suits to breathe i caught a glimpse of the pleiades like an ocean of stars but if not an ocean a see at least and then we see a spaceship arrive you close your eyes to shade the blinding light we clutch our hands tight as we ascend been shooting at the stars i hope we still friends you look out the window and you grip my arm as the ship moves to infinity and beyond even the milky way seems small and far the big dipper just turned into one big star but i look into the windows reflection why cause i can see the stars in your eyes even when we out of space or in outer space when your

far i feel like i gotta yell up to the stars all of my silent friends dont seem like they getting answers frustration grows its like its cancer of the soul you told me to give all my problems to you i cant carpool but i got no problem following you just give me a sign let me know i aint miss my exit i pray that you help me not to miss my exes i pray that you help me not to fuck up the next shit she stayed and i thank you for that shit cause god knows you know that id be lost without her its bad enough the music aint turn out to be what it was in my eyes just two years ago it seemed so sacred the deeper i get into this the people get faker i hate it i thank you for my fans for real cause well if not for them i prolly wouldve killed myself so many nights i spent crying in my lonesome here with the same people years ago that killed your own son im living with them but im living for you making the most out of this mission ive been given to do enlightening the world with my music and i think that im doing it messages for my listeners telling me to stay true to this telling me i saved their life but in retrospect they be saving mine waiting for my chance imma stay in line this frustration wont outweigh my patience i got her and music so i aint mind waiting for short thank you for the sun and the rain i learned joy i learned pain but you always remain even when i questioned your loyalty you would bring more to me becoming a man but keeping in touch with the boy in me i know the future gon be brighter than this its about time i get this light bulb switched know the future gon be brighter than this so get this light bulb switched sincerely yours'}]}]

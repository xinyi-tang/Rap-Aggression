of a gang color which eventually accelerated the cancer that killed his mother and he was married to a white woman that they called a nigga lover and it became a full time job not to kill a nigga i wonder does he still consider that hes still a nigga weve all got choices and the real recognize whats real and chose but hes basically still undercover in his civilian clothes all the right reasons but he may not even get that love again cause salarys still not enough to be a republican issues of growing up without a dad had one too many one night and forgot his badge a brawl ensued with a racist cop didnt stop and ask cause he was sure that he was a nigga when he shot his ass oh mother magnolia your daughters and your sons made the sky start cryin as they hung lifeless from your arms

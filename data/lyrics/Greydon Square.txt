practice come on back go ahead and have a seat so tell me what seems to be the problem greydon well the problem is i dont feel like i have a outlet anymore like i dont have any reason to do this i sit at the keyboard and feel lost but then when i strike a key everything opens im not joking ive literally left my computer smokin but then i hit the chord d minor music is like my woman and i feel like its my job to find her not for her vagina but for what is inside her this is my heart my soul i would never deny her her grace and speed her own space to breathe the beautiful sounds that she makes when makin me agreed upon the keys and as i play i start imagining things and while imagining things i start rambling things mostly gibberish first but i hope i gather long enough just to spit up a verse but wait focus focus on the music because without that ingredient the verse is gon be useless so before you know it ive added some hats but just to be different im not gonna use no snare on this track so then i add some strings yeah and i think i know exactly what this track needs how bout some flutes but i dont wanna over-do it so long as it sounds good then im tellin the truth this is the formula i use when i stand in the booth to precisely execute like i do in my room with realistic lyrics to boot and i may be young but i guarantee you these lyrics are true but i should be able to control em at least i feel like a beast i think i need my medication increased whatchu think doc doc okay mr collins were going to increase your existing prescription of abilify to 90 milligrams ill see you in three weeks for another eval'}, {'name': "Pandora's Box", 'lyrics': 'yea greydon square yo grand unified theory forever yea listen dont hate me cause im atheist hate me cause i tell the truth which by default makes me atheist youve been spoon fed and you dont even see it you just absorbed the religion thats native to your region you cant believe it so you wont believe it because the church has taught you that faith belongs in the place of reason you have two sects spawned from judaism a regime that might as well have uday and kusay in em with saddam in the middle clutchin a bomb telling you hes gonna use it if you dont touch the quran with a sister regime to me thats equally obscene that threatens you with hell if you dont feed the machine cause if the bible was written by man and man is flawed then what does that say about the bible and god and if that same book was written by a man who wasnt trustworthy what does that say about that book ya heard me they say im in so far over my head that im supposed to be dead pandoras box but i aint opened it yet they just mad cause im telling the truth and what worries em most is that youll listen when i tell it to you question it all ask why god said let there be light before he created any light producing objects question it all why is the poor forced to live in projects while the rich are given a hill to live atop it what makes republicans and democrats any different than bloods and crips absolutely positively nothin bloods wear red republicans have red states crips wear blue while democrats have blue states bloods are right side repubs are right wing crips bang left side democrats are left wing bloods and crips fight for territory on the streets republicans and democrats fight for territorial seats its goin down if you catch mr clinton in a texas town with nothin but republicans around hell go the way of them people george executed he shouldve known he was outta bounds and snoop aint no safer on 108th and crenshaw and they dont care who invents law hell see them red flags hangin and them black chucks flamin there aint no difference between these people its all gang bangin they say im in so far over my head that im supposed to be dead pandoras box but i aint opened it yet they just mad because im telling the truth and what worries em most is that youll listen when i tell it to you question it all how can democrats and republicans have colors but they hit us wit a gang injunction question it all how they can have rallies mass members in bunches but then try to shut down our every function this thing is stronger than blood deeper than crip more vicious than a republicans slandering lips more suspicious than a democratic party of six being sat next to a pope without religious intent with the fbi watchin the cia watchin the fbi jottin a group of muslims with bombs strapped to their chest plottin a bunch of christians prayin for hellfire to stop em but not because theyre planning to take life but because theyre not prayin to the same damn god that they are and it aint right they all just need to sit down and pop some pills before they get us all killed with their religious ideals and thats real they say im in so far over my head that im supposed to be dead pandoras box but i aint opened it yet they just mad because im telling the truth and what worries em most is that youll listen when i tell it to you question it all why these rappers talk about sellin drugs but these labels try to tell me to change my content question it all why i need a club hit to make it but i seen other people do it like kanye and common question it all'}, {'name': 'Ears', 'lyrics': 'yeah grand unified oh you know that already okay rational response what you know that too alright fine what ever im

of life in which they cant lose instead of killing for an invisible man they cant prove nobody dying over a book no crusades no war on terror headed by bush im dreaming of a world where there is no such place as the bible belt instead of looking up you look inside yourself and when you do find yourself you go help somebody else instead of praying you do well to maintain your bodys health now

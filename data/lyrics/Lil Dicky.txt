Snoop Dogg)', 'lyrics': 'hello how can i help you hi my names dave burd i have an appointment today its probably under lil dicky actually im a im a rapper so okay and who are you here to see uh snoop dogg says here snoop d-o-g-g oh yeah hes right down the hall first door to your right give him a knock and he should be right with you thanks its uh this door right here right mm-hmm thank you grab a seat thanks im dave very nice to meet dave what it do you can call me dogg let me just check your sheet no problem sir let me just say im a big fan of the shit that yall make i cant lie i been thinking about this all day all good theres a reason that we called dave let me start with your background where you come from sure i was undergrad down there in richmond before that oh you talking bout my hometown yeah i was born out of philly grew up in a little silly old town called cheltenham it was in the suburbs upper-middle wealth around so real shit you aint never had to struggle for much i wouldnt say it like that we just had a different kind of trap elaborate well i aint never had a tool but i had to be the man at school like i was doing shit i had to do so when i finished undergrad im cool and i can get whatever job i wanted but the job you wanted wasnt all that bumping yeah and i saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that when you been racing them rats you aint been making them raps boo-hoo what a hardship how you paid to get the rap shit started man my bar mitzvah money but dont diss me buddy i wasnt one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose i mustve wanted this a lot i had something to choose ha look at that i can say theres something to prove up in your ass yeah i guess thats enough of the past what makes you want to do rap oh my god its the best bitches let me draw up on their breasts literally i can reinvent myself i get a forum to project myself its never boring every morning i wake up and try to best myself i never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself its kinda healthy cool now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals sure in a club and a couple niggas threaten you uh i wouldnt do shit and i dont even get what that got to do with this shut the fuck up raps like life if you wanna do this then you wont get far acting like a little bitch nah thats my niche dont get offended by this but thats the market yall missed thats the target ill hit and thats the heart of my pitch i wanna do this whole thing different what the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different uh you know i-i think like you know traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time but traditionally speaking this shit works right nah like i get that but i-i just think that you know you dont know if it could be working even better and i think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out i dont mean any disrespect by that im just saying i have a different background like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant so what are your biggest strengths well my flow is crazy i can switch that amazing for example i can be like aint nobody fucking with lil dicky when he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous ripping this shit like its never been did and the rhythm is never predictable cause i can switch it deliver this shit in whatever cadence you bitches prefer all right all right i get it top of that lyrically im pretty damn clever go got a long bottom bitch call the hoe neville whoa and i blow it from the jump derrick rose knee oh you can say im pretty smart how i know better and yall been winning like pistorius its no feat bro i can go on and on im taking over and they mad like father-in-laws ok enough of the punchline that aint showing me you different than the other guys well i dont know if they can run it like that but aint nobody else doing funny type rap whats that well i can tell a story about my morning watching boy meets world and jerking off to topanga lawrence like the 14 year old topanga oh this shit like a joke to you i dont get it nah it aint like that i just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual like as a guy so when i get up on the mic i aint finna just lie real recognize real right yeah i guess so what you tryna do five years from now tell me bout the dude well i dont care about the money like its the respect that im wanting honestly i just want to be one of the greats where they gotta bring your boy up every debate i dont wanna leave the game the same in a nutshell whats your legacy well i wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand-up rap put the random rap in demand like that for the people that was anti-rap yet the fans of rap start to recognize that anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left that shit sound pretty damn complex i guess i wanna be the best i just wanna do it my way and turn the whole game sideways and show people you aint gotta be resigned to the highway you can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight i aint mad at that well thanks man thats my plan of my attack just let me in and imma rap the plaques and i aint about to win them back to back im bout to win them like its back to back to back to back to back til i stop rapping you aint even sold a damn album yet true thats a lot of talk from a wily vet let alone a young rook nigga you misread me nah this aint a book nigga well thats one of my flaws im too competitive dawg no you just fucking repetitive dawg i get it you trying to be better than all but you aint shit until cheddars involved i get that i gotta prove myself no shit you aint done shit think about that though only doing this a couple of years one tape and im like this this shit is aight for your first shit but you dont know if its your worst shit you dont think finding out would be worth it it might be it might not but imma put your ass to work kid wait like like i have the job like really well one more thing let me see if you could put a hook together what would you do for the hook for this song you want me to make a hook up

think im ready i mean if im being completely transparent with yall uh like my lifestyle hasnt really changed that much uh you know considering uh where i think im at musically like im still at the point right now where pretty much any bitch that tweets at me anything remotely flirtatious i have seen not just one of your pictures i have seen the entire catalog thats the type of shit thats goin down over here right now so i am definitely ready for that uh next step yknow what im sayin i think its close too i think its close like uh diddy tweeted about me uh yknow that i dont know if he handles his own twitter i would assume he probably doesnt actually but like im so confident that i feel as though like me and diddy will have a moment just about this outro like when were both sittin

for me if im bein real like i had never actually done it before but i was feelin like i was some king shit yknow what im sayin so i was like man imma fuck this bitch to some miguel right now uh actually to be completely real to you i i will never fuck a girl to music again i found the whole thing to feel like completely cliche like i dont need my emotions dictated to me by like music it makes me feel like im in a tv scene takes all the like realness out of the moment for me like actually was actually super weirded out by it so but still like i am about to let my hair down and i dont know i just feel like its all comin i feel like like im literally like about to find out about everything and its exciting and i yknow i i had pinkeye last week and i remember thinkin that as i like

you whatever you paid for them tickets no it is not another act today that just give it to you like in the way we do makes it exquisite making this hittits taking this trippits goin on the internet and facing this critics saying his sickic is great to hear but all the compliments it aint paying me shitic its like this music thing is my drug habit and your making me kick it but on the other hand me having to go without it would make me get sinic gather you to prevent that all it would take is a little bit of basic incentive cause i dont think know that without your support a career would flaking and finish so take a quick minute put your whole damn face in this business see what i go through on a daily when numbers dont add up and take a quick visit though the mind where patience was

calling my name with everyone in the world to see in me and i dont know whos to blame cause i dont hear dont hear you calling my name if i just happen to stop it would be catastrophic but since this matter of topic lets get back to options i could just get a job and get right back to docking move in a wack apartment and confine myself into a one room shack is hardly what can happen i wouldnt make enough to provide for the family without the rapping but your asuming that we get paid good cause we keep touring but in actuality you dont know about this game nigga you dont know about this rain you

records i dont eat if i dont eat then its time to go and count on streets if i dont leave my 7 to a jail house cell then my destiny is 6 feet hollow deep and thats all i need a rest in peace for poor old me im hearing that everybody love me boy you got a real good way of showing me said i dont hear dont hear you calling my name said i dont hear dont hear you calling my name with everyone in the world to see in me and i dont know whos to blame cause i dont hear dont hear you calling my name if i could go back to when all of this happened and start when rappin was innocent where niggas was happy you did it a rally for love when streets were replenishin but those are my sentiments now the shit is so menacin venom in many men give them an in and they would go in your window and load right up under your nose in a minute man how can i get it back im too addicted with signing this autographs taking this pictures with people i never knew its in my ligaments im just compelled to do whats in my spirit when everything is genuine hand me that sliver pen i get strait with you right after this gentlemen tired as fuck but im full of adrenaline cause i just dont know when i can do it again

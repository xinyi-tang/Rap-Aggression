tell your friends and you wanna spit it out its pretty hard to do youd hate to think youd bring em down but even though youd want em to if they were in need of you even though the front is hard to hold its still easier and every day it shows its face youre getting killed inside its so twisted its the thing that makes you feel alive so you cant leave it its like you half need it that inner demon it makes you want to quit believing i know how you feel and really oh i know its true cause honestly thats exactly what im going through my wings are broken my wings are broken youre in the eye of the storm should be glad in a way thats where lightning is formed all these clouds that surrounded around you fighting a war youve seen this violence before but you dont know what youre fighting it for its so hard to let your heart embrace it you see its hard to take it its getting larger and you cant escape it its like you cant uncover this grey cloud on you so you sit there hoping it rains down on you itll swallow you whole you know that thats standard you see the ground but its bound to be a crash landing you need to be here now you always go within you want to touch down its hard to do with broken wings its like your hearts pain is everything you cant take forget about your past days remember that our scars fade i know how you feel talking bout it wont do but youll be fine thats exactly what im going through my wings are broken my wings are broken'}]}]

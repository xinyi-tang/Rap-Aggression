a song on the radio from the past and get a flashback cinematic when it plays back write a story of my life and be the soundtrack 1146  central on a school night i used to sneak out the window i was little my brother neil was in the middle on the bottom bunk roof where i wrote my riddles get a chill every time i get a visual used to think i was invincible everyday shoplifting competition at the mall was the ritual never won i never made a good criminal got a problem at the school with the principal and back then all the music was original i was young and dumb the future was invisible take a look back take a look back never go back when i reminisce about those passed thinking its a trip how fast we live flashing back to the sandbox with my clothes dirty and my jeans was ripped swinging on the monkey bars trying to keep my grip jump on the trampoline till my knees give in always physical i was a little crazy kid then i got into the music and i found my niche found a gift couldve found a ditch even when bullets came in my direction somehow they missed tried to grab me and stab me somehow they slipped like a force-field stayed the course at the lords will even when its over imma go to war still even when im gone ill be making noise still i could never live forever but the voice will always knew id be somebody that the world feeled take a look back at your life nowx8 i admit sometimes i speed for no reason sometimes i roll up the weed for no reason take a breath of fresh air for no reason cause you never know when youre gonna be leaving so i get it with the old clique and reminisce while were thumbing through a box full of old flicks laughing at the funny clothes and the outfits take a look back take a look back yeah they say time keep on slipping but im sunk in the coupe i just keep on dipping switching up the gears i keep on shifting daydreams my mind it keeps on drifting like j dilla imma keep living never feel like a beats finished im a perfectionist never really happy with it so ill mess with it its a god-given talent i was blessed with it thinking back from the past occurrences its endless i can only scratch the surface but its a new day so i let the sun shine through the window when i crack the curtains only death is certain only tax is certain take a break for a minute then its back to work take a look back at your life nowx9'}, {'name': 'Under

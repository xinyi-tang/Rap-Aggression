'woke up at 7 my day seemed more than i prayed for got dressed to head out and ride to school on my skateboard new kid in class i sat alone takin notes while the hoodlums were makin jokes at the clothes that my momma paid for seemed like everyone was a part of some gang invasion tattoos the initiation parolers im on probation soakin up the vibe as i study for information cause lately i been deprived of a normal day but today on my way to eat lunch some kid approached me he told me we should be cool if only he got to know me cause on this side of town i would need some protection its crazy reckless and dangerous unless im some sort of gangster im only safe with the police he said his name was blank i dapped him up at the busses i was kinda skept about him at first cause i didnt trust him the more i got to know him i couldnt tell what his motives were hopin that he was sincere somethin told me let go but the only thing on my mind was patience searchin twice for a different life i was tired of waitin cause me and blank had similar views and conversations and feuds with knowledge mainly bout school and college that was my true but regardless he was type cool when i was wit him introduce him to my family they were rockin wit him my momma told him make sure you look out for my son and before she could finish her sentence he quickly just interjected and said dont you even stress it i got it under control its been two months since we met it seemed like wed gotten close some cat approached me and tried to beef wit me i just froze then i see blank pounded and stompin homie without his cloak called me his brother and told me he got me to the fullest even if that mean bullets bullies gangs aks and choppas till they kill us thats the realest shit i ever witnessed a few weeks later my uncle sold me a honda civic a 93 with no license plates and no registration just thinkin about every place that ima go when i finally get it and then he asked me for a ride around the block some distance from where i was parkin and instantly i knew the spot was sketchy my momma would kill me my intuition told me not to i knew it was wild and plus i knew i had no business or place on that side of town and i read about some chick that went lurkin without a sound and got murked her body found in that dirt with a thousand rounds it was worse than abandoned buildins of bandits villians and scammers killers provokin gangsters but maybe im overthinkin maybe i might be straight just as long as i pump the brakes and try not to think about it just trust ill be fuckin safe and then i told him lets go hop in he dapped me up he started tellin jokes the whole ride there had me crackin up as we were gettin closer i felt funny my stomach turned then he told me go left make another turn go right and drive slow as i look it was all abandoned and quiet not a single person in sight nobody standin and right when i pulled the car to the side he said right here sit still turn the car off and chill thats when i start to panic he told me relax then he pulled the keys out the ignition and hopped out and laughed then my life flashed in an instant he inched to my driver door then i tried to lock it i couldnt ripped me right outta my seat and then grabbed the side of his jeans and then pulled out the shotty and all i heard was a screech and he shot my arm into pieces im thinkin i must be dreamin another shot to my chest and my stomachs squeezin my breath or my lungs collapsin im down on my fuckin knees askin him why he looked at me i looked him dead in the eyes and he smashed my face with the barrel and i throw my teeth to the sky and then uh i heard a cocks shotgun sound of the shotty cock back he pressed it hard against my head and blew my fuckin top back im still conscience im breathin im still movin no clue as to why im not dead all this blood that im losin and i heard my car drive off and i looked up and saw the sun and that was all that i saw then i heard my conscience tell me get up nigga get up youre losin blood oh my dont fall asleep or youll die stay awake and move as much as possible theres no time find some help or try to yell you aint too well oh god wake up nigga wake up wake up nigga wake up woke up at 7 my day was worse than i prayed for got dressed then head out down the stairs from the eighth floor new kid in class he sat alone takin notes while my niggas were makin jokes at the clothes that his mama paid for had no family but was cool with the local gangstas tattoos and now im on parole and probation for breakin rules that life was all i knew all i wanted was to do was cruise smoke weed and say fuck school wanted guidance cause all my role models i would look up to was indicted a young dude with no logic i went to church and told the pastor said fuck you now im violent and this game that always looked out for me vouched for me and adopted me said they wanted to rock wit me and i wanted to get down guess there was somethin missin everything comes with a price theres only one condition all you gotta do for initiation is kill an innocent victim and leave em there with no witnesses or no snitches if you do that youd be down with the clique and thats for life so dont you ever think you getting outta this shit and i thought about it soakin up the vibe as i study for information tryna choose my victim plottin the weakest prey but today on my way to eat lunch i approached him and told him we should be cool if only i got to know him cause on this side of town he would need some protection its crazy reckless or phony unless he some type of gangster and he only stayed with the police he said his name was ross capicchioni and i dapped him up at the busses was kind of skept about me at first cause he didnt trust me then the more he got to know me he couldnt tell what my motives were hopin that i was sincere but little did he know i was tryna snake him and pop a brick just need the perfect opportunity im tired of waitin a murder runnin through my head i knew that death was comin he introduced me to his family i was jealous of him his momma told me make sure you look out for my son- and before she could finish her sentence i quickly just interjected and said dont you even stress it i got him to the fullest even if that means bullets bullies gangs aks and choppas till they kill us i

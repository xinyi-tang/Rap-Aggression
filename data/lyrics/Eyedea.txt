i stay afloat in the stream like we all should i used to love the cool summer breeze and grey days with leaves falling off the trees now i know what i miss - i cant hold in my fist but - one last touch would set me free somebody set me free from this trap that you all call the real world its all old but in my heart im still young and my soul says that i should have fun but to have one - you gotta have some kind of billfold to survive they say you have to have a job you hate 9 to 5 every day pushing you closer to the grave what do we throw what do we save what do we know well what are we waiting for lets lay on our backs and talk about the clouds shapes i know all the different memories are floating in the sky the ones of the earliest years catch my eye and as you grow you find new hills to climb - but theres nothing like doing something for the first time yeah now instead of the sky i look at the ceiling just trying to get a good feeling so if you talk and im giggling its not cos im not listening im just trying to be a kid again flipping up these notebooks looking for my childhood staring at the sunset looking for my childhood flowing with the music looking for my childhood walking through this cold world looking for my childhood but were did it go i dont know it just disappeared but were did it go i dont know - last time i checked it was here but were did it go i dont know it just disappeared but were did it go man i dont know somebody must have stole my red balloon and if i never get anything at least my names common enough to always be on the souvenir license plates the sign says walk and yet they try to cut me off cos i was wrong when i thought pedestrians had the right of way in the center of my innocence pretense are a percentage of resent for my indolence - but i can be credited for everything that i finish without a footstep to follow the walls are full of color yet the ground is so hollow so what happened to the happiness we had inhabited the magic averages the year were we stop our imagination - start with the education stifling the childhood id turn us all back into children if i could id turn us all back into children if i could x3 and lead us all to play in the woods excuse me excuse me excuse me have you seen my red balloon i need to catch up with it pretty soon it makes me complete while i have a heartbeat i plan on flying with it to the moon whys everybody acting like they grown up in a big rush to take on responsibility im telling em stay young cos the day will come and when it does you cant surrender willingly now if theyre feeling me or not still ive gotta get my point across the coin is tossed into the air into a void of loss i call both heads and tails address the trail and set my sails but i wanna have fun - i wanna live like there aint no tomorrow with no consequences to my actions - concentrating on my passions laughing at the ripples in the lake from the rocks i threw innocence of not knowing whats labelled impossible the curiosity that killed schrodingers cat was the only thing that kept him alive - matter of fact i wanna wonder - wanna be scared of the thunder and the dark and the figments of my mind that live under my bed but nowadays your monsters cant be ignored they demand full attention and causing a war for 18 birthdays i felt fine but i lost my childhood somewhere down

reality with the absence of ego i cant explain it i cant find the words the world probably thinks were disturbed but when i stood upon those rocks i was in hell and yall were both there with me by your faces i could tell and i admit it was dangerous we could have fell behind a trapdoor and never got out but the fact that we did see that means were strong and the experience was all well worth it

safety lets just watch ourselves paint ourselves in this painting its crazy but at least now we know it we can put together a puzzle with the piece we unfolded the brains a fun house a madmans playground but i know myself thats something i can really say now i hope you both feel the same each personal heaven can breath forever and if were insane fuck it were insane at least the three of us

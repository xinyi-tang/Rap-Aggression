cinderfellas his name to make it interesting its me dana dane i lived in a house with my cruel step-dad and two step-brothers who treated me bad i cooked i cleaned i scrubbed the floors and i was like an errand boy runnin to the store my brothers they used to boast and brag weve got fresh gear and youve got rags even worse than that to make me feel low they gave me a straw hat while they had kangols girls used to say dane youre so cute but you gets no rap with them polyester suits well one day up the avenue there was a man surrounded by the fort greene crew he said hear ye hear ye come one come all the princess is having a royal ball if you can rap also dress fresh you might win a date with the sweet princess well i um ran home when i heard the newsflash i bust through the door straight to my step-dad i said step-dad may i and before i could finish hell no he replied my brothers were goin they were geared down even pops was goin for a piece of the crown they flaunted they haunted they knew what i wanted we can and you cant is what they taunted they all stood there laughing in my face and as they walked out they said clean up this place cinderfella dana dane but im the rapper dana dane with fame cinderfella dana dane yes im the rapper dana dane with fame well i shrugged i hissed theyre all tryna diss id get them back if i had one wish before i could make my thought a phrase there appeared a man from a puff of haze he said whats up dane my name is hurb im your fairy godfather you know it word now ive came here with the main purpose of granting you your fondest wish i said hurb my man just make me fresh and im sure that i can handle all the rest with a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot and i was tough and on my body a slick silk suit on my feet there was argyle socks and a fresh pair of ballys from the bally shop i showed him my hat and dont you know with a snap the hat became a kangol once again his hands began to flow then he changed my skateboard into a volvo he checked me over passed me the keys and said one more thing before you leave you must return before the stroke of twelve or youll turn back into your old self cinderfella dana dane but im the rapper dana dane with fame cinderfella dana dane yes im the rapper dana dane with fame i jumped in the volvo went on my way i got to the party bout ten id say it was after eleven when i rocked the mic and by the time i left the stage the people were hyped the princess was staring in disbelief reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth she waved her hands like hello hi then gave another gesture like come here guy i left the stage girls came in flocks fists were swingin from the hard rocks i heard a sound not a tick nor tock gong first bell before twelve oclock no time to waste i broke out in haste the princess followed in a futile chase a quick steady pace is what i kept lost one of my ballys on one of those steps for the volvo i continued my stride about this time i heard gong five i was down the block when i heard gong eight and the princess scream out wait wait wait wait cinderfella dana dane but im the rapper dana dane with fame cinderfella dana dane yes im the rapper dana dane with fame i was almost home when my luck ran out and there went my suit my kangol and clothes my fresh volvo also went too and there was no denyin that my night was through the one bally shoe the freshest thing i sported jumped on my board for home i skateboarded made it to my pad no time at all went to my room or better yet the four walls hid the shoe away still feelin pleased then jumped in my cot to catch some zs early the next morning when i awoke i threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat went into the front my family stared at me sayin wasnt that you nah it couldnt be they kept askin me as i did my chores my butt was saved by a knock on the door who is it thats what my brothers barked the princess this sweet voice remarked she said she was lookin for a certain man who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand the family ran around with their heads in the air bringin on shoes from everywhere she just shook her head a nod of relief sayin no thats not the one that im lookin for chief i ran in the room and got my shoe and said is this the one youre referring to well she said yes and youre so cute but wheres your kangol and slick silk suit i put on the shoe there came a flash of light and i was tough in the gear from just last night looked out the window saw the volvo said to my family ive got to go we drove up the avenue the princess

yourself oh and dont give out my number thanks now i can still remember when we first met it was one day that i would never forget six oclock the approximate hour not really cloudy expecting sun showers i was taking a stroll halfway cross town then like expected the rain came down i picked up my pace for home base i raced ran into a soft object in my haste on the ground we faced her in silk and lace and with my eyes her body i slowly cased the pouring rain had drenched her dress but i loved the way the cloth had clinged and caressed excuse me that was my first words spoke stood her up on her feet and gave her my trench coat somehow it happened while i covered her back when her eyes and mine first made contact the looks we gave changed the way we were now it was us and not me and her well you wouldnt understand well maybe you might i guess you would call it love at first sight now even the rain pour was easy to ignore only this young lady is what i saw she was a sweet female tender not frail other words beautiful no need for details i introduced myself hi my name is dane can i get you out of this pouring rain sure she said by the way im jackie staring at me as i hailed down the taxi we jumped in the cab slowly moved off she was holding my hand and it felt so soft now on my ear she gently chewed and i knew it was more than just gratitude i took it upon myself to take her to my house i guess she didnt mind because her clothes were doused paid the cab his fee took out my house keys opened up the door said enter please took her to the bathroom said hang your clothes on the line and gave her one of my shirts from calvin klein went to my room took off my wet wardrobe i freshened up a bit and put on my silk robe we met in the front near the roaring flames where we sat quietly sipping on champagne her eyes said thanks beyond the use of words and the crackling flame was all i heard it felt as though we were on our honeymoon as we moved from the front into the bedroom we made passion love the night we met and by the time we fell asleep there were no regrets well you wouldnt understand well maybe you might i guess you would call it love at first sight i woke up the next morning she was not there maybe shes fixing breakfast or doing her hair i got out of my bed threw on me house coat when i noticed on the mirror shed left a note saying sorry dane i could not stay please meet me 1 oclock where we met yesterday well i had time two hours and a half so i laid out my clothes and took a bath i ate a good breakfast had time to spare so then i got dressed and i dally over there i reached my destination not a cloud in sight it was cool kinda windy but the sun was bright now i was on time but she didnt show and that was about twenty minutes ago i stayed a little longer about a half an hour felt a raindrop maybe its a sun shower i was soon to see that my thoughts were wrong because the raindrop became an all-out storm and there i was standing in the rain and the lady that i looked for never came well i was hurt and it showed in my face as i tracked in the rain backed to my place slowly i walked hoping to bump into her me be in love nah i barely knew her i got home angry and depressed and my bally shoes were a total mess but that was the last thing on my mind as i sat on the couch staring into time well i had her number and she had mine but if she really wanted me she would have dropped me a line but day after day and weeks went by but she didnt call even to say hi i would have called her first but ive got my pride and i really dont care to myself i lied now there was no reason for me to be sad just remember that good time that we had cause i learned a little something that you should know to keep some things you got to let them go

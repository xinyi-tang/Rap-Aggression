another kid whos black it aint all that when the shots are flyin back you made a choice and the choice you made was wack kinda tipsy with the liquid confidence pullin your pistol when it doesnt make sense to be the bigger man you figure but in the end it dont pay when youre livin by the trigger chorus 2x yeah its the master of the who what where and the why but still i got a problem with seein my brothers die ive been around and lived past the average age of us in every obituary a full page of us the game is money but what about inner wealth the mental the spiritual and physical health but still everyday the city is a test thats why some people feel a gun is the best no doubt i pack protection but every altercation or situation doesnt deserve blastin i mastered precisions choice of

about hurt we can make a profit now i need beats because were about to put an album out that conversation wasnt friendly thought he had some beats that he could lend me but he told me that they have a price tag and a beat from him would cost 10 gs thats when my heart turned empty i wasnt trying to get them free but didnt think that you would rob me i recorded all them songs for you and never asked you for a dollar now you tryna charge me click on the window pane we can all see the rain somebody gotta let me know what part of the game is this wait now i got a call from lorraine hello whats up shes no longer working with frank at all and told me the reason she made the call is to tell what really happened with the major talk they liked you cham and they said youre raw they liked your music

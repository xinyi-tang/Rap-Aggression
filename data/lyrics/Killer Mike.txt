us own acres if none of us own acres and none of us grow wheat then who will feed our people when our people need to eat so it seems our people starve from lack of understanding cause all we seem to give them is some balling and some dancing and some talking about our car and imaginary mansions we should be endited for bullshit we inciting hand the children death and pretend that its exciting we are advertisements for agony and pain we exploit the youth we tell them to join a gang we tell them dope stories introduce them to the game just like oliver north introduced us to cocaine in the 80s when the bricks came on military planes a few months ago i told the american people i did not trade arms for hostages my heart and my best intentions still tell me thats true but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not the end of the reagan era im like leven twelve or old enough to understand the shitll change forever they declared the war on drugs like a war on terror but what it really did was let the police terrorize whoever but mostly black boys but they would call us niggers and lay us on our belly while they fingers on they triggers they boots was on our head they dogs was on our crotches and they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches and they would take our drugs and money as they pick our pockets i guess that thats the privilege of policing for some profit but thanks to reaganomics prisons turned to profits cause free labor is the cornerstone of us economics cause slavery was abolished unless you are in prison you think i am bullshitting then read the 13th amendment involuntary servitude and slavery it prohibits thats why they giving drug offenders time in double digits ronald reagan was an actor not at all a factor just an employee of the countrys real masters just like the bushes clinton and obama just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters if you dont believe the theory then argue with this logic why did reagan and obama both go after qaddafi we invaded sovereign soil going after oil taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby same as in iraq and afghanistan and ahmadinejad say they coming for iran they only love the rich and how they loathe the poor if i say any more they might be at my door shh who the fuck is that staring in my window doing that surveillance on mr michael render im dropping off the grid

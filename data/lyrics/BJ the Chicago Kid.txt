his rent cause he lost his job a month before that he lost the custody of his daughter six months before that her mother said she wont see her father and this before he did a year when them charges brought up i shook my head turned around then found a 100 i dont know why you keep blessing me i dont know why you keep blessing me i dont know why you keep blessing me i dont know why you keep blessing me i dont know why i dont know why i dont know why yesterday i invaded privacy of a home the day before that my partner had fronted me a zone a week before i had loaded bullets inside that chrome two weeks before that i shot them bullets and he was gone a month before that i cursed my mother then slammed the door six months before that i hit my woman she hit the floor i stormed out then seen a black honda accord them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy so today i laid in my bed stared at the ceiling closed my eyes then asked myself how i was feeling i analyzed on how a saint can play the villain is my life coincidental or just god willing i came to grips jumped up and looked out the window see my nigga had that same little boy that didnt know bullets is nameless i guess this is meant for me to give them a 100 then trash my pistol now i know why you keep blessing me now i know why you keep blessing me now i know why you keep blessing me now i know why you keep blessing me now i know why now i know why now i know why so i can bless you so i can bless you so i can bless you lord help me cause i need you i know this weed is burning and im on drink number two but its all to soothe the pain from this cold cold world sometimes i think you can help me but this bus here is temporary so im talking to you this sick world will drive a sane man crazy birds dropping out the sky daughters having their fathers babies and this the news i hear when my god kids nieces and nephews turn a year i wonder will it get better a little cheddar when it get better but the rest of thats cash make last years christmas gift you my bad but somehow you keep blessing me but somehow you keep blessing me but somehow you keep blessing me but somehow you keep blessing me but somehow but somehow but somehow if i just keep the faith i know youll be right there sometimes it may not seem that you are there but youre there i feel youre there youre everywhere and i thank you for protecting me in these streets from danger seen and unseen i never know what happened the night i wasnt there something told me leave so i left it was the next morning three got shot after the club all listening to that small voice oh you saved my life'}, {'name': 'King Kong', 'lyrics': 'yeah i smoke a little bit might drink a little hennessy but when it boils down to me doing my job i

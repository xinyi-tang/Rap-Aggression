the best coast lookin back now of course it was bogus the whole argument was where we lost focus we got hopeless not with the lyrics and music but with hip-hop and how we used it or abused it you know how the crew get you like it cause you choose it 1991 we opened our eyes with human education against lies we tried to talk about the state of humanity but all these others rappers got mad at me they called me captain human another message was sent self destruction dont pay the fuckin rent remember that nobody wanted conscious rap it was like - where these ballers at where can they call us at all

came at 659 and you told me to move aside i asked for bread and the chicken that was fried sound effect food cooking and you said that i wasnt purified she replied i wasnt notified i had no idea that

deeper they part of what you understand there is no palm or fist your perception of your hand movements is calling it this palm and fist doesnt exist but they do when your hands is used like this by you so try to look at words while you cookin the herbs look at the birds is that a bird a birds is that what it is is that whats building his nest thats not all of it a birds is what we calling it but really what is a bird really look past the word symbols to see the bird clearly hear me if you never name yourself you are forever subject to everyone else your name is your nature it makes you lower or greater im not a hater but youll see later so back to the palm and the fist overstand the palm and the fist are symbols of the hand its what the hand is doing not what it is the doing is the effect

know your history the what and the how and be aware youre making history right now so since history is a record of past events lets give the future something it can respect uh meta-historical listen listen meta-historical history is a record of past events that tries to make sense of the past with past evidence the life of a free man makes history in many ways but history makes the life of a slave history is an art not a fact and the historian no matter how scholarly is never exact we are living in an omni-event - keep in mind everybodys doing everything at the same time the activity of the whole globe could never be recorded our linear vision is too distorted we think in terms of a then b then c then d then so on we say this began here that ended there so our conversations can have something to grow on but in reality the omni-event has no beginning or end that you can detect we make beginnings and endings in mass confusion so we can talk about the things were doing but this is all an illusion we see reality according to the symbols were using can words exist without letters can birds fly without feathers who changes we or the weather these words are forever so im calling these oratoricals meta-historical uh meta-historical beyond history look meta-historical i got so much more for you hip hop is a culture raps not all we do when the teachers calling you to higher order you try to slaughter your own foundation whats wrong with you we got so much more to do you order your history history dont order you heres what we ought to do - im talking to you lets do this different from how these others do history documents its society - the physical society - not whats inside of me so my history will lie to me cause its based on physical space not my psychology i got a new philosophy its called hip hop and it needs a new methodology now follow me history documents whats physically there or whats physically here but hip hop is not here or there its not physical hip hop is a shared idea we all share it from different dimensions we all hear it but hip hop is all spirit so lets get down with what the truth is theyre not recording hip hop theyre recording what produces winners and losers cds and tours thats not hip hop thats rap music folklore thats why these rappers are no more - cause they followed no principles traditions and no laws thats why the future

there is no palm or fist your perception of your hand movements is calling it this palm and fist doesnt exist but they do when your hands is used like this by you so try to look at words while you cookin the herbs look at the birds is that a bird a birds is that what it is is that whats building his nest thats not all of it a birds is what we calling it but really what is a bird really look past the word symbols to see the bird clearly hear me if you never name yourself you are forever subject to everyone else your name is your nature it makes you lower or greater im not a hater but youll see later so back to the palm and the fist overstand the palm and the fist are symbols of the hand its what the hand is doing not what it is the doing is the effect that causes what it is so what is it when you live by the definitions of what others give living history of what others live youre like a kid i mean a goat being led to the slitting of your own throat wow for many theres no

the class word up yall know youre going through chambers now haha check this out did you know that ronald reagan was a deejay and napoleon in egypt wrote graffiti did you know that history is just a replay and you affect it by what you do and what we say did you know that history is just a memory and we are the present memories of future centuries you gotta know your history the what and the how and be aware youre making history right now so since history is a record of past events lets give the future something it can respect uh meta-historical listen listen meta-historical history is a record of past events that tries to make sense of the past with past evidence the life of a free man makes history in many ways but history makes the life of a slave history is an art not a fact and the historian no matter how scholarly is never exact we are living in an omni-event - keep in mind everybodys doing everything at the same time the activity of the whole globe could never be recorded our linear vision is too distorted we think in terms of a then b then c then d then so on we say this began here that ended there so our conversations can have something to grow on but in reality the omni-event has no beginning or end that you can detect we make beginnings and endings in mass confusion so we can talk about the things were doing but this is all an illusion we see reality according to the symbols were using can words exist without letters can birds fly without feathers who changes we or the weather these words are forever so im calling these oratoricals meta-historical uh meta-historical beyond history look meta-historical i got so much more for you hip hop is a culture raps not all we do when the teachers calling you to higher order you try to slaughter your own foundation whats wrong with you we got so much more to do you order your history history dont order you heres what we ought to do - im talking to you lets do this different from how these others do history documents its society - the physical society - not whats inside of me so my history will lie to me cause its based on physical space not my psychology i got a new philosophy its called hip hop and it needs a new methodology now follow me history documents whats physically there or whats physically here but hip hop is not here or there its not physical hip hop is a shared idea we all share it from different dimensions we all hear it but hip hop is all spirit so lets get down with what the truth is theyre not recording hip hop theyre recording what produces winners and losers cds and tours thats not hip hop thats rap music folklore thats why these rappers are no more - cause they followed no principles traditions and no laws thats why the future remembers me krs rhyming for the

kenny couldnt afford that so we would go to the park when they was jammin to hear rap i used to listen till the cops broke it up i always thought to myself damn why they fucked it up but nevertheless i was in love with the microphone and it stayed that way until i left home on the streets of new york now im free but with freedom comes big responsibility i used to walk around driven by the force i remember how large super rhymes was when he fell off i used to wonder about crews that used to rock they were large but none of them could manage to stay on top do you ever think about when you outta here record deal and video outta here mercedes benz and range rover outta here no doubt bdp is old school but we aint goin out after livin on the streets alone some years went by i signed myself into a group home i used to watch the show i dream of jeannie and dreamt about when will i be large like whodini but i was messin with graffiti on the subway and gettin chased by the cops almost everyday i knew it had to bea better way see so i would go to my room blast run dmc around 1984 i left the group home again alone still dreamin about the microphone gimme a chance man i know i can rock it but i had to worry about puttin money in my pocket so when i reached the shelter i met my helper dj scott la rock and we both loved hip-hop i was takin suckas out in the shelter system yeah there was

do is battle they cant write a song so their careers wont last long around this time i used to hang with ced gee and dj scott la rock used to buy gold with eric b i didnt meet rakim till later with scott i remember we were jammin at the rooftop it used to irk me when these critics had opinions scott would say just keep rappin ill keep spinnin we had a fucked up contract but we signed it and dropped the hip-hop album criminal minded we told the critics your opinions are bull same time eric b and rakim dropped paid in full hip-hop pioneers we didnt ask to be but right then hip-hop changed drastically people didnt wanna hear the old rap sound we started samplin beats by james brown in the middle of doin my philosophy scott was killed and that shit got to me but knowin the laws of life and death i knew his breath was one with my breath i had nothin left and it was scary so i dropped by all means necessary another hip-hop group that was a friend of me was a revolution crew called public enemy it takes a nation of millions to hold us back these two albums set off consciousness in rap but all along im still lookin around and all i can see are these rap groups fallin down do you

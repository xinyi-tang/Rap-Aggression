it is all the same when youre looking with stronger lenses so concerned with images but its there in the words images are just imagination thats whats so absurd have you heard the pig now knows its fat and the zebra is confused because its white and its black so whats fact right and exact when everything changes change the way you look at the world the world changes instead of reasons to die find a reason to live instead of reasons to fight find a reason to give instead of reasons to talk find a reason to sing instead of reasons to take find a reason to bring instead of reasons for i find a reason for we instead of reasons to try find a reason to be instead of reasons to look find a reason to see people i am pleading find another reason we are so busy noticing money dont grow on trees we forgot that food does and that its the food that we need you see i done traveled all over the isles and seen the poorest people with the wealthiest smiles so what is rich or poor less or more whats victory whats defeat and who keeps the score who sleeps more soundly the prince or the pauper who speaks more profoundly the professor or just the talker the walker or the driver who travels the furthest the explorer or the pirate who is providing a service who decides what is worthless versus what has a purpose did the so-called civilized world not think the earth a flat surface yesterday so

these reasons to never be the person we want to be because im still healing all these wounds that are burned so deep inside of me we think that were smart and that makes us dumb think that we feel the most and that makes us numb weak because were convinced that we have the power because we can make buildings and guns but not a single flower were just waves but think were the ocean because its easier then admitting we dont know where the current is going were just flowing why do we feel it needs controlling waves just rolls with the ocean until they reach the sand so lets roll with our part until we reach our land acknowledge that the fear in our hearts totally in our hands its not a thing we just think imagine the earth decided that it was afraid to spin so dont be afraid to sing with your voice thats what it is for the more we run from truth the closer it gets to your door look back through the ages everything changes change the way you look at yourself the self changes'},

forces of evil the devil himself proud of the magnificent achievements of his children decided to call a special banquet for the greatest thieves in all the land he sent invites to thousands of the greatest murders rapists and general-assorted scum inviting them to attend his palace at the dawn of the new moon each thief would be given a chance to stake his claim as the greatest messenger of murder upon the planet and the devil himself would then decide who should be crowned king after many days of deliberating all of the petty thieves such as street criminals have been found far short of the required level of wickedness and there were just four sets of thieves left in the competition they were the monarchs of empire a cartel of bankers the heads of religious orders and the third-world dictators each set of thieves appointed a spokesman to give his case to the devil we have recorded these events for posterity uh listen uh okay yo first up was the thief of the worst reputation dictator of a third-world nation he looked the devil in the eye as he spoke in an oh-so-serious tone dear mr devil i am the greatest thief there has ever been on earth please tell me who else more than me personifies your work i came to power in a military coup i murdered the elected president he wanted to use the resources of our country for our peoples benefit i proved to masters in the west i could kill my own people just as well as the best so i took over the so-called independent country when the foreigners left sent squads of death to those who would suggest in power should be the one they elect erected a statue of the great man that raped our mothers stole our lands thats how little self-respect i have dont fight slavery it makes me glad account in switzerland rolls royce murder and rape cos i want new toys dont want a portion but a whole fortune with that profit whats a little bit of torture even outlawed my indigenous culture and language and history and taught our people to only worship colonizers and of course me thief its the banquet of the thieves come and dine with me its the banquet of the thieves the banquet of the thieves the devil was so impressed with this wonderful man he almost ejaculated on his hands but the monarch of the empire said excuse me mr devil id like to speak if i may who do you think trained this amateur dictator to behave this way yeah im sure before i came along his country was far from heaven but look of the carnage i caused all over the earth its got to be the work of the devil countless deaths mass enslavement deliberate starvation of whole nations the dictator tries his best but looking at me hes just an imitation who do you think pays his wages he would love to be trading places ive been doing this ting on the roads way back way back way back since the middle ages everybody knows hes a criminal element they think im democratic and benevolent and that shows that im really devilish cos people think im heaven-sent i couldnt care about democracy you all know no one elected me the people love me despite my crimes sucka mcs wanna bite my shine so blingin out of control you would vomit dont even touch dough but my face is on it im a pervert whos in the cloak of the clergy yes im a pervert whos in the cloak im a despicable character i use my position of authority and spiritual reverence im a despicable character mr devil allow me to speak for all of the religious leaders that leech in the world of creeps im initiated i take the peoples faith and dissipate it with false promises hollow oratory dont need a gun its daylight robbery dear mr devil i thought you would like it how i use their faith in god to keep them blinded put on a nice voice read them a book and they believe that i am not a crook tell them god will repay them in the next they give me their life savings so i can buy jets all the reports about child sex none of us have ever gone to jail yet this system of stealing so appealing convinces the victims their lives have meaning monarchs boast about conquest but needed my blessings to get it done and all of the dictators use my books therefore they are just my sons the devil was sure this was the winner and was just about to put an end to the dinner but then the man from the banking cartel stepped up and said i think im the biggest sinner all of those three depend on me all they ever do is defending me cos i paid for all of the things they have of course and all of the lives they lead paid for the guns bombs and the tanks thats why you see there is always more i turned sciences basic appliance into a client of weapon and war paid for monarchies armed robberies i make monopolies out of property never shot a gun nor killed anyone myself but billions die cos of me who needs a threat i make a debt out of thin air just sit back and collect every single day whatever they say the people need me just to connect it yet none of them knows what i look like yet all of them spend my money to look nice they want more no ones pure i hold the keys to every single door sell sex and drugs profit and lies earth and skies ill even sell life ill even sell freedom for the right price but

believe me its the maangamizi its the maangamizi maangamizi meaning african hellacaust because we paid a hell of a cost and dont really know what was lost and the process aint ever stopped since black civilization dropped through internal greed and external plot same ones that taught the ancient greeks greece and rome helped to bring to their knees then islam spread across northern africa with slavery and massacres too many hurt refused to convert spread south and west and people dispersed christianity is not alone in using race and religion for power to expand desert caravans took slaves across sand where they staged a revolt of the zanj enemies always invented mythologies curse of ham so-called prophecy after the migration there was some reinstatement of autonomous nations then floating on the waves of the seas came a plague a genocidal disease with arms and heads they looked like men really they were just dogs on two legs when they first came some of our people said go most welcomed them into our homes we didnt know they had hearts of stone frozen by western europes cold also there were scumbags among us willing to work for white conquerors honours and with that collaboration began the largest forced migration in the history of nations how many millions dead at the bottom of the ocean thrown overboard like property stolen or jumped overboard rather than be sold on a mother with her baby in arms hold on what awaited was not just enslavement but a genocidal impulse craving they committed unspeakable abuses to make a nigga from an african human took a woman ready to give birth tied her limbs to four posts held firm in a main square made every slave watch covered her in raw meat let off a pack of dogs if anyone watching even a relative made a sound kill them for the hell of it this was every day not the exception the science of gynaecology was perfected on black women no anaesthetic they said a nigga bitch couldnt feel pain pathetic hang a man from a tree cut off his penis force people to eat their own faeces put people in zoos in a cage chimpanzee black human ape and it was upon this here atrocity europe became the dominant economy now they play games pretend its about names its a scheme for unequal trade imagine the largest companies today if all of their employees got no pay for all of the centuries profit was made black skin was always branded slave even the child of the masters rape could be killed or sold because black blood in her veins but the ancestors fought back got free probably have not heard of jean-jacque dessalines probably dont know the haitian revolution caused the french to sell half of america nor know the role that africans played in the civil war for that same america if you aint heard of nanny of the maroons or bogle you probably believe what they told you but if they set africans free because all of a sudden they grow a conscience tell me this why were the slave masters given compensation and those that suffered not given a thing why did they then invade africa and make africans slaves in their home with the belgians killing 10 million souls in the congo alone why then jim crow why apartheid why did black wall street burn that night why collaborators will work for such evil willing to be tools against their own people why africom imperialism for the new age but with a brown face on it thats right imperialism for the new age but with a brown face on it some will try their best to justify this torture by asking you who the slaves were brought from as if we do not know tell them get the hell out every genocide ever has had sell outs and the largest wars of humans were fought between the people of western europe so by your rationale its cool to kill frenchman they killed germans that look like them absurd right but when your skin is white different set of rules you can abide by dark suffering is not humanized no surprise we still see ourselves through their eyes darkies became legally human during the course of our parents life and the freedoms we have only occurred cos our ancestors spilled their blood to the earth they changed that much are you so sure the worlds darker people still the most poor so its our task to put an end to this even those like me with our heritage mixed if a knife is in your back 9 inches and its only been pulled out six when the wound starts healing and we stop bleeding and bleaching can it begin to fix when the plague of self hate is no longer a weight so great push you to kill one another when we put a stop to false charity that gives with one hand and bombs with the other when the imf and world bank along with their puppets no longer strangle our nations when the invaders dont have military bases in so many places when the jail cells are not packed with black backs and the gats and the crack are no longer factors when we celebrate true self-determination not a few token bit part actors when the truth is told and

greed and external plot same ones that taught the ancient greeks greece and rome helped to bring to their knees then islam spread across northern africa with slavery and massacres too many hurt refused to convert spread south and west and people dispersed christianity is not alone in using race and religion for power to expand desert caravans took slaves across sand where they staged a revolt of the zanj enemies always invented mythologies curse of ham so-called prophecy after the migration there was some reinstatement of autonomous nations then floating on the waves of the seas came a plague a genocidal disease with arms and heads they looked like men really they were just dogs on two legs when they first came some of our people said go most welcomed them into our homes we didnt know they had hearts of stone frozen by western europes cold also there were scumbags among us willing to work for white conquerors honours and with that collaboration began the largest forced migration in the history of nations how many millions dead at the bottom of the ocean thrown overboard like property stolen or jumped overboard rather than be sold on a mother with her baby in arms hold on what awaited was not just enslavement but a genocidal impulse craving they committed unspeakable abuses to make a nigga from an african human took a woman ready to give birth tied her limbs to four posts held firm in a main square made every slave watch covered her in raw meat let off a pack of dogs if anyone watching even a relative made a sound kill them for the hell of it this was every day not the exception the science of gynaecology was perfected on black women no anaesthetic they said a nigga bitch couldnt feel pain pathetic hang a man from a tree cut off his penis force people to eat their own faeces put people in zoos in a cage chimpanzee black human ape and it was upon this here atrocity europe became the dominant economy now they play games pretend its about names its a scheme for unequal trade imagine the largest companies today if all of their employees got no pay for all of the centuries profit was made black skin was always branded slave even the child of the masters rape could be killed or sold because black blood in her veins but the ancestors fought back got free probably have not heard of jean-jacque dessalines probably dont know the haitian revolution caused the french to sell half of america nor know the role that africans played in the civil war for that same america if you aint heard of nanny of the maroons or bogle you probably believe what they told you but if they set africans free because all of a sudden they grow a conscience tell me this why were the slave masters given compensation and those that suffered not given a thing why did they then invade africa and make africans slaves in their home with the belgians killing 10 million souls in the congo alone why then jim crow why apartheid why did black wall street burn that night why collaborators will work for such evil willing to be tools against their own people why africom imperialism for the new age but with a brown face on it thats right imperialism for the new age but with a brown face on it some will try their best to justify this torture by asking you who the slaves were brought from as if we do not know tell them get the hell out every genocide ever has had sell outs and the largest wars of humans were fought between the people of western europe so by your rationale its cool to kill frenchman they killed germans that look like them absurd right but when your skin is white different set of rules you can abide by dark suffering is not humanized no surprise we still see ourselves through their eyes darkies became legally human during the course of our parents life and the freedoms we have only occurred cos our ancestors spilled their blood to the earth they changed that much are you so sure the worlds darker people still the most poor so its our task to put an end to this even those like me with our heritage mixed if a knife is in your back 9 inches and its only been pulled out six when the wound starts healing and we stop bleeding and bleaching can it begin to fix when the plague of self hate is no longer a weight so great push you to kill one another when we put a stop to false charity that gives with one hand and bombs with the other when the imf and world bank along with their puppets no longer strangle our nations when the invaders dont have military bases in so many places when the jail cells are not packed with black backs and the gats and the crack are no longer factors when we celebrate true self-determination not a few token bit part actors when the truth is told and there is the dignity to remember the dead

aint got a clue from whom that we came but giving it names is one of the ways that we entertain deeper and deeper i go searching for something unknown wander the road take my soul standing for something i love who can read the riddle of life i have wondered many times if shakespeare was right and it signifies nothing just that heavens bluffing but the jokes on us cos we discuss all this deeper stuff  cos it all just eventually turns into dust must we change our disgust for the lust of depravity and adjust our  cusp of reality i aint sussed enough to give myself clarity but i do know enough not to trust any charity cos the language of death is spoken by a golden breath i know that i am golden but i am not hoping to be next yes i do cling to this vanity and i dip my pen in the ink of insanity when mind numbing disparity passes as normality the comedy of history is we dont see its a tragedy who can read the riddle of life we aint given equipment for recognising the signs so lines are unclear trying to undo tears is near enough impossible were clung to fear the cost of letting go is less than we know but still its way more than we are willing to show so we cling harder my mother and my father as if theyre the only ones that gave birth to a child they say life is a gift but i dont know if it is not because im pissed i literally dont know what it is are we spirits from another realm cast down into this world or just animals focused on how we feed ourselves heaven or hell whats the perspective a strong desire to return to the source and we call it a death wish but maybe they have just settled the riddle no beginning or end but theres a life in the middle'}]}, {'name': 'Doublethink', 'date': '2010-05-03', 'tracks': [{'name': 'Welcome to Dystopia', 'lyrics':

they think you want the whole thing four kids and a good job a big house and quiet down and thats cool stay in school go to uni with those like you if on the other hand you want to travel the world just to meditate thats what you should do you dont need permission from the stay-in-line commission just to be who you are follow your heart follow your dreams like a kid again they want to write you off with the end of the bit of pen let them have it theyll come around eventually if not it wasnt meant to be its their problem june or december theres one small thing that i think we should remember its not that serious sometimes i want to fight sometimes i want to cry but then i must remind myself its not that serious were gonna make it through and find a better way that works for me and you if you dont conform society whips you with its displeasure if they were happy they wouldnt care whichever way that you chose what you do with your time long as you aint hurtin no one then thats fine problem is we hate to see another live the life that we dream and i dont mean big screen and flashiness just free carefree true happiness wake everyday excited whats to come never work a minute when doing something you love so when we judge ask why is it because we feel life passed us by its never too late to get rid of the stress theres a whole world out there just look up from your desk and say that the world is mine and if youre not having a good time then youre wasting your time you know yo people think im really serious right and i was for a long time im not gonna lie and pretend i wasnt but then i realize that sometimes you just got enough i mean im not as serious as people think yeah i like to talk about the issues in the world but at the same time we cant let them bog us down yes the world is not perfect we all know that its just not that serious go to a comedy show man take a bubble bath or i dont know buy a pink dressing gown do something crazy that people wouldnt expect you to do lets drop these things called egos on the floor stamp on them and try to get on with it and realize that its just- just dont take yourself do god damn serious what about the problems in the world things aint golden yeah i agree but will worrying solve them no im not saying ignore by all means do something if you feel for a cause but you cant feel poor enough to enrich one single person on this planet and you cant feel bad enough to fill one single soul with happiness so the biggest challenge we face is just keeping a smile on our face if stock markets crash or girlfriends leave you people dont like what they see when they see you football teams lose bands will split but the thing we must remember is this- its just not that serious it really is not today walk up to somebody and talk to them find out how their day was dont worry if they think youre crazy- which they probably will and you people in the train- when you dont want no one peering over your shoulder to read your letter stop taking yourself so god damned seriously its just your newspaper if i want to read a bit of your newspaper whats the problem you should open it up and let me have a good look yeah thank you ladies and gentlemen this is akala not taking himself very seriously and there are probably a lot of people that are angry about that and think ive gone crazy why am i not screwing up my face why am i not trying to be the best grime mc im trying to make nice relaxing songs whats my problem i havent got a problem its just that i stopped taking myself so god damn seriously thats it have a good

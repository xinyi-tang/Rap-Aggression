highly favored by god i experience great victories supernatural turnarounds and miraculous breakthroughs in the midst of great impossibilities i receive recognition prominence and honor petitions are granted to me even by ungodly authorities policies rules regulations and laws are changed and reversed on my behalf i win battles that i dont even have to fight because god fights them for me this is

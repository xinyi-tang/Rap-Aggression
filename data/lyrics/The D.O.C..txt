tried so ive intervened to make you fall like a tide no disappointment cause my beatll soothe like an ointment suckers with static approach and get smoked like a joint feeling ignites the flame i mean i burn like a lighter but with a hip-hop groove cause im a writer the hero or great take a stand then well see thee in chronological order starting with me a rap introduction the suckers destruction

with the d-o to the c im like a whirlwind pyramid and im letting you know i get ill when i hear the bass go yeah thats the sound and you know its down but you know why whys that cause ive been around and youve heard the sound of the doc and the new style that ive found its quite unorthodox but still bass and enough to make you dance so i picked up the pace and let it ride like a cyclist and see it

the individual i feel successful when receiving the residual but as for you you all should know when i say lets get hype im letting the bass go now thats the way it should be done i know thats on the one and that is fun to see a sucker standing weary and girlies on the tip standing near me the bass was the topic so i dropped it added some dope lyrics and then i locked it on track 24 in a machine to make you move on the hip-hop scene cued up dre and i knew that he would know that on the one i would let the bass go because a dope jam is what i gotta make i make it rattle cause you love it when

ayo stan dre layed the tracks im laying the vocals we need some guitar that rocks know what im saying so um lets do this verse 1 shes a rich girl but not the ordinary extraordinary a little too much to carry possessed by a demon on a mission no man alive can refuse her proposition from this fantasy but to me she was more than a bad dream she was a nightmare for man took her sex appeal and she taunted twisted the brother until he did just what she wanted direguard the laws of the other man sacrificing the plight of the brother man im not the type to let a woman make me weary but to resist hed have to be a fairy nothing that a brother wouldnt want to indulge in drives a porche and her purse is bulging her body in the form of a romantic medly but be warned shes beautiful but deadly verse 2 shes all about the bank roll you can tell by the gold eyes deep enough to engulf your soul shes like medusa but you wont turn to stone if you watch her one fatal look is all it takes and shes got ya on your knees and no more to spend and youre still thinking how you want to see her again itll be difficult but boy it aint no joke saying nothing going on but her rent and a car note youre wondering how in the hell little knowing youre the reason that she lives so well guessing so hard youll submerge her attraction but she go so many son youre a subtraction now you roll like youre crazy attitude

simple suggestion but a warning to whom it may concern if knowledge is the key then i think its time you learn for there is not the problem some leaders are acknowledged i dont follow em i turn into another degree and find the d-o to the c and growing like a tree and causing much destruction because im crushing complimented much yeah but never blushing hard like a criminal and im subliminal in my own right its dope cause im original funky unmistakably so when the vocals are done then you know its all a matter of setting a date for americas most complete artist but wait make sure you keep the facts in mind dont mess with the great cause the doc is like a nine with a voice telling you the bullets direction im talking murder but thats another section i need to explain while keeping my composure theres no jerking a sucker when he knows youre nothing but a villain and youll kill him so hes in fear but there aint no need in spilling your guts to a nut no i am not your equal meaning your equivalent im more like heaven sent i got it together so clever no one could sever remember this forever no one can do it better repeat 3x knowledge is the key and hard work is the fee for me to be the great at the start and remain to be a threat til the opposition is warned taking as long as a song cause i was born with instincts to kill a grave mentality over the edge and you say you want to battle me at your own risk approach and be hosted and in the end you may win or be roasted but seeing its part of a game you think if you hang close to the one and youll claim but thats lame and im damn another loser without an apology so next time im a use a little more force to get the message across its the doc on the boards creating demonstrate some relate to easy listening but heres a christening of what youve been missing an exhibition a new hip-hop introduction smooth lyrical gab and i do the conducting drop it on a rhythm suckers face it but new to the masses its like im starting classes better bet i understand the direction in which im going in fact when im flowing the news is a constant change from one minute to the next im different cause i always show flex and its essential thats why i got it together to the letter and no one can do it better repeat 3x i need to make it understood the doc is not a hood not at all though i carry a weapon when im stepping im not a murderer not in the sense that youre accustomed i buy in the system with suckers smoothly bust them opposition is taken and thats a quote from the doc and the doctor cause this aint no joke so if you smile heres the outcome your teeth are gone your mouth is numb dont get involved unless youre willing to risk murder by mic cause when theyre illing you gotta be weary watch for cautious yo be warned by dre and out the project born capable in any and every cause yo i get heavy when introduced to a medley such is the case before the bass started wompin i had to hook up with the boy from compton searched and found the sound then accepted the job of making la well respected of course with the help of a gang thats ruthless peace to the homies as i do this what i mean and mc ren is in the house ice cube definitely in the house dj yella yella cold with the hoes and eazy-e is stupid chilling cause he knows yo no matter whos badder ill be the dopest forever by kicking lyrics so clever

showing emotion he normally wont at 56 he re-evaluates possibly regretting some decisions that hes made black is turning grey patches of his age reflecting from the glasses of a pass of every page passionately dave reads reading on occasion dreaming of the day when he can do the same thing hes always wanted to write thats all hes wanted in life with two daughters a son and a remarkable wife hes in a bind he has to provide a family is relying on him merely to survive his father died at 56 so hes well aware how vital a father figure is how big of a responsibility it is to be a good husband and care for your kids never miss an event helping them with their homework discipline to prevent things when theyre older his only son is only 21 and focus as a poet has only just begun papa isnt dumb he understands what this means his dream is my dream my dream is his dream i close my eyes and i can see his dream the sacrifices he made for me his dream put it aside for his family his dream yeah so imma keep it alive yeah and so he targeted to be the dream guardian guarding it from anything and anyone whose harming it but in his heart he knows the hardest thing about it is giving up on his dream to be all about his kids as he kisses the lips of the misses for 24 years going on the 25th he thinks to himself this alone is a wealth its greater than whats bought and then sold on the shelf sometimes a dream is all that we have we have to continue to dream cause once it is lost amongst other thoughts then what really are we what are we i close my eyes and i can see his dream the sacrifices he made for me his dream put it aside for his family his dream yeah so imma keep it alive yeah so he sits back at his desk cracking his knuckles and back of his neck faxing a paper displaying his name on another application explaining the main things they should know but the things that they dont and over the phone he could never expose are the things that distinguish him as an adult the role that he chose the role in his home and at home hes a leader a father hell prove it by using his son and his daughters in their life hell be playing the part of the one who inspires the one we admire his only son is only 21 and focus as a poet has only just begun papa isnt dumb he understands what this means his dream is my dream my dream is his dream i close my eyes and i can see

didnt buy it wanted more springsteen earth wind fire felt that was fine but to rhyme had to try it couldnt hide the fact i wanted to rap bought jay-zs cd with my own cash man and that was back around 98 with the annie sample and money aint a thang and even though i really couldnt relate i kept studying and listening and stuffing my face and now i dont feel like im fallin cause im so high that i dont feel like im fallin and im so fly that i dont feel like im fallin cause im so high that i dont feel like im fallin then came high school started picking up a mic thought i was cool my friends said homie you know that your white dude i said what fa real oh its all good cause like this when i tried it liked it flipped it hyped it insisted the mic cause this shits just right just like that

uncle c passed away leaving us empty and it hurt real bad disturbed real sad but we had to move on so infact real fast we wrote this song bout fallen ones and miscues and misviews of the misuse of words used to diss dudes so true in a serious face im convinced god works in mysterious ways like everything happens for a reason i had to believe it cause that would explain why they leave us as in people that mean everything i got love for them all theyll be there if i fall but'}]}]

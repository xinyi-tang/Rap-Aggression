you a hit without me on the shit if you woulda put d12 on it wish i coulda did more than try talkin you into comin up off of it i know it wasnt my fault but part of it probably is i think of all of

feel so much guilt and yall didnt harbor resentment but its hard to pretend that yall aint got none i just wish i had words but i guess there just are none for this to my partners i cant say how sorry i am this is not how i planned for our story to end i love all of you men but i just cant be the guy everybody depends on for entire careers cause thats not even fair i will always be here but that

every letter i get but something told me to go ahead and open it but why would someone pray for you when they dont know you you didnt pray for me when i was local and as i lay these vocals i think of all the shit i had to go through just to get to where im at ive already told you at least a thousand times in these rhymes i appreciate the prayer but ive already got god on my side and its been one hell of a ride hasnt it just watching it from a opposite standpoint man boys got to look nuts and thats the only word i can think of right now on how to describe the shit this is like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit so be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it cause it might just come back on you ten-fold i said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it cause it might just come

address park in your drive feel like ive been waiting on this moment all of my life and its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva my knife is out and im ducking on the side of your house see its sad it came to this point such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i aint here for your empathy i dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy its revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reached my full potential i peeked continue to peep still bent low then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way round to the back porch man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this you dont plan for intruders beforehand surprised to see me cat caught your tongue gag chloroform rag gag almost hack-up a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans ironys spectacular huh now whos a faggot you punk and heres your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck its just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it were in the car right now - wait here comes my favorite lyric im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die and hey heres a sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy hows this for a publicity stunt this should be fun last album now cause after this youll be officially done eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initials i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it since youre in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here two more exits time is quite near hope we dont get stopped no license i fear that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea as cops appear in my drivers side mirror oh god police aaaghh hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least new plan stan slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car well gotta go almost at the bridge ha ha big bro its for you slim this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again part 2 produced by streetrunner i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in when they say all of this is approachin its end but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again backs to the wall im stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause im talking a lot of shit but im backing it all up but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience im the ringing in your ears im the polyps on the back of your tonsils eatin your vocal chords after your concerts im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged grab for some water but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on you every woman you insult batter but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rappers persona is half a facade and matthew and stans just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til its gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them im the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow if you dont stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits when its time to walk away im every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if theres anything you have left to say less it makes an impact then dont bother so fore you rest your case better make sure youre packin a wallop so one last time im back before it fades into black and its all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryin to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts

daddy i dont have one my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon and had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap im loco its like handing a psycho a loaded

follow you must rick rubin my little padawan a jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts are entertainin but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk full of such blind rage i need a seein eye dog cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on oh its on the ram-page couldnt see what i wrote i write small it says ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with whitewalls had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard so as long as im on the clock punching this time card hip-hop aint dying on my watch now sometimes when im sleepin she comes to me in my dreams is she taken is she mine dont got time dont care dont have two shits to give let me take you by the hand to promised land and threaten everyone cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing now whats your name marshall whos your daddy i dont know him but i wonder is he rich like me ha has he taken any time to show you what you need to live no if he had he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad i wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad yeah dad im the epitome and the prime example of what happens when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and makes you want to get up and start dancin even if it is charles manson who just happens to be rappin blue lights flashin laughin all the way to the bank lampin in my k-mart mansion im in the style department with a pile in my cart rippin the aisle apart but with great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content completely despondent and condescending the king of nonsense and controversy is on a beat-killing spree your honor i must plead guilty cause i sparked a revolution rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level boost it but several rebuked it and whoever produced it hip-hop is the devils music does that mean it belongs to me cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper rappers better stay clear of me bitch cause its the-- its the time of the season when hate runs high and this time i wont give it to you easy when i take back whats mine with pleasured hands and torture everyone that is my plan my job here isnt done cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing whats your name shady whos your daddy i dont give a fuck but i wonder is he rich like me doubt it ha has he taken any time to show you what you need to live so yeah dad lets walk lets have us a father and son talk but i bet we wouldnt probably get one block without me knocking your block off this is all your fault maybe thats why im so bananas i a-ppealed to all those walks of life whoever had strife maybe thats what dad and son talks are like cause i related to the struggles of young america when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles now theyre rippin out their fuckin hair again its hysterical i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles yeah uh-oh better beware knuckle heads the sign of my hustle says dont knock the doors broken it wont lock it might just fly open get cold-cocked you critics come to pay me a visit misery loves company please stay a minute kryptonite to a hypocrite zip your lip if you dish it but cant take it too busy gettin stoned in your glass house to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out mr mathers as advertised on the flyers so spread the word cause im promoting my passion until im passed out completely brain-dead rain man doing a bankhead in a restraint chair so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare or get shanked in the pancreas im angrier than all eight other reindeer put together with chief keef cause i hate every fuckin thang yeah even this rhyme bitch and quit tryin look for a fuckin reason for it that aint there but i still am a criminal ten-year-old degenerate grabbin on my genitals the last mathers lp done went diamond this time im predicting this one will go emerald when will the madness end how can it when theres no method to the pad and pen the only

what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy were fightin a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities thats what we call em pigsties for theyre like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like were stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins its like were drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky cause this keeps happening throughout history

were applying but mcdonalds seems to be the only franchise thatll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder thats why its at a stalemate and cant arrive at a compromise so its black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin white cops in the black neighborhoods who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and thats racism the fear that a black face gives em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us section-eightd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every days another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes its like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my its more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers

marchin til we reach congress but theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick

my drivers side mirror oh god police aaaghh hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least new plan stan slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car well gotta go almost at the bridge ha ha big bro its for you slim this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again part 2 produced by streetrunner i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in when they say all of this is approachin its end but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again backs to the wall im stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause im talking a lot of shit but im backing it all up but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience im the ringing in your ears im the polyps on the back of your tonsils eatin your vocal chords after your concerts im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged grab for some water but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on you every woman you insult batter but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rappers persona is half a facade and matthew and stans just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til its gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them im the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow if you dont stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits when its time to walk away im every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if theres anything you have left to say less it makes an impact then dont bother so fore you rest your case better make sure youre packin a wallop so one last time im back before it fades into black and its all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryin to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here

bout to explode all over the canvas back with the yoda of rap in a spasm your music usually has em but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt follow you must rick rubin my little padawan a jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts are entertainin but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk full of such blind rage i need a seein eye dog cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on oh its on the ram-page couldnt see what i wrote i write small it says ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with whitewalls had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard so as long as im on the clock punching this time card hip-hop aint dying on my watch now

no if he had he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad i wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad yeah dad im the epitome and the prime example of what happens when the power of the

my k-mart mansion im in the style department with a pile in my cart rippin the aisle apart but with great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content completely despondent and condescending the king of nonsense and controversy is on a beat-killing spree your honor i must plead guilty cause i sparked a revolution rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level boost it but several rebuked it and whoever produced it hip-hop is the devils music does that mean it belongs to me cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper rappers better stay clear of me bitch cause its the-- its the time of the season when hate runs high and this time i wont give it to you easy when i take back whats mine with pleasured hands and torture everyone that is my plan my job here isnt done cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing whats

son talk but i bet we wouldnt probably get one block without me knocking your block off this is all your fault maybe thats why im so bananas i a-ppealed to all those walks of life whoever had strife

bankhead in a restraint chair so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare or get shanked in the pancreas im angrier than all eight other reindeer put together with chief keef cause i hate every fuckin thang yeah even this rhyme bitch and quit tryin look for a fuckin reason for it that aint there but i still am a criminal ten-year-old degenerate grabbin on my genitals the last mathers

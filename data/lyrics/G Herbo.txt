a time around the southside a young black man grew up in a house had a pops he never knew with a mom thats strung out his granny careless just about say hell never make it out of the hood and had a handful of aunties that can vouch young nigga named malcolm all his homies called him malc his big brother off in college malcolm took another route from gang banging caine slanging moms threw him out the house stuck on probation on and off since thirteen been in and out soon as he turned seventeen shit got super wild still a juvenile he just totin rugers now he shootin now streets got him malcolm ruthless now mom still gettin higher than a motherfucker malcolm used to cry at night shit a motherfucker ask hisself why every time he lie at night sometimes he even pray to god and wish he die at night he grown now had to get it on his own and he know nobody gon be there when he alone and so fuck it he just gon continue doing wrong then one day he woke up left the house and he forgot it but somethin inside told him malc dont leave the ratchet but he aint worried he been lettin niggas have it all his life he been bangin stealin robbin killin livin heartless foolish godless stop to get some swishers from the supermarket usually leave the car in neutral but he parked it looked in his rearview two niggas black charger black hoodies black masks black carbons he know its over try to duck they start sparkin shells poppin everywhere malc get out of there he goin crazy cause he knew it malc gon fire car hit up windows out but that was minor perfect setting it just wasnt malcolms time yet rush in the house yell out to moms where my iron at and now he gettin high dont know where his mind at niggas was masked up he dont know where to find em was getting out and he aint know who was behind him but when he catch a nigga slippin gon remind em two weeks later malc right back in that action whip fixed new tints painted slidin malc ridin late night round three somethin a youngin focused he just lookin and he peeped somethin charger parked car on he see the heat runnin bitch hop in the passenger he tryna freak somethin malcolm ready his adrenaline just keep rushin but he aint

day he on a mission watch the charger pull off right away sweet as fuck nigga pull right up to where he stay aint even watching malcolm trail a nigga all the way he super geeked been tryna catch some action all the day charger pullin in parking in the driveway malcolm parked some houses down he finna violate but somethin tell him malc you might as well go all the way you came this far before you spark them might as well rob him walked him right into the safe it was a piece of cake gave him 300k and malcolm blew his face away aint give a fuck that nigga up he gave that bitch a break but feds watch the whole thing while they investigate they had surveillance on a niggas house since yesterday malc runnin out the back door with the cheese ks pointed in his face dont move freeze his mind racing run throw the gun shoot squeeze but malcolm came right to his senses got down on his knees the saddest thing about life it keep revolving same story different niggas same apartments same gutter same group of people starving malcolm couldve stayed in school and got a job though but this was all that malcolm knew he from chicago compare and contrast if malcolms from a rich town his whole life was planned out since he was six pounds let me break it to a core so you can focus more at the age he started puberty he was smoking weed his eighth grade graduation he was toting heat his freshman

southside a young black man grew up in a house had a pops he never knew with a mom thats strung out his granny careless just about say hell never make it out of the hood and had a handful of aunties that can vouch young nigga named malcolm all his homies called him malc his big brother off in college malcolm took another route from gang banging caine slanging moms threw him out the house stuck on probation on and off since thirteen been in and out soon as he turned seventeen shit got super wild still a juvenile he just totin rugers now he shootin now streets got him malcolm ruthless now mom still gettin higher than a motherfucker malcolm used to cry at night shit a motherfucker ask hisself why every time he lie at night sometimes he even pray to god and wish he die at night he grown now had to get it on his own and he know nobody gon be there when he alone and so fuck it he just gon continue doing wrong then one day he woke up left the house and he forgot it but somethin inside told him malc dont leave the ratchet but he aint worried he been lettin niggas have it all his life he been bangin stealin robbin killin livin heartless foolish godless stop to get some swishers from the supermarket usually leave the car in neutral but he parked it looked in his rearview two niggas black charger black hoodies black masks black carbons he know its over try to duck they start sparkin shells poppin everywhere malc get out of there he goin crazy cause he knew it malc gon fire car hit up windows out but that was minor perfect setting it just wasnt malcolms time yet rush in the house yell out to moms where my iron at and now he gettin high dont know where his mind at niggas was masked up he dont know where to find em was getting out and he aint know who was behind him but when he catch a nigga slippin gon remind em two weeks later malc right back in that action whip fixed new tints painted slidin malc ridin late night round three somethin a youngin focused he just lookin and he peeped somethin charger parked car on he see the heat runnin bitch hop in the passenger he tryna freak somethin malcolm ready his adrenaline just keep rushin but he aint buggin he dont want homie to see him comin he gon wait cause when he run up he aint leavin nothin fuck around and hit the bitch up he aint even bluffin look what malcolm got now yeah this his lucky day he on a mission watch the charger pull off right away sweet as fuck nigga pull right up to where he stay aint even watching malcolm trail a nigga all the way he super geeked been tryna catch some action all the day charger pullin in parking in the driveway malcolm parked some houses down he finna violate but somethin tell him malc you might as well go all the way you came this far before you spark them might as well rob him walked him right into the safe it was a piece of cake gave him 300k and malcolm blew his face away aint give a fuck that nigga up he gave that bitch a break but feds watch the whole thing while they investigate they had surveillance on a niggas house since yesterday malc runnin out the back door with the cheese ks pointed in his face dont move freeze his mind racing run throw the gun shoot squeeze but malcolm came right to his senses got down on his knees the saddest thing about life it keep revolving same story different niggas same apartments same gutter same group of people starving malcolm couldve stayed in school and got a job though but this was all that malcolm knew he from chicago compare and contrast if malcolms from a rich town his whole life was planned out since he was six pounds let me break it to a core so you can focus more at the age he started puberty he was smoking weed his eighth grade graduation he was toting heat his freshman year of high school he was posted what you need before he saw his senior year his life was over life was over over its over its over over'}, {'name': 'Crown', 'lyrics': 'you know since day one we probably never ever had shit

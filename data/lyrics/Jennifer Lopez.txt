seguir mi loco corazon a todos lados y he amado como ama una mujer que ve en su hombre el paraiso si me entrege lo hize total y si falle volvi a empezar y a levantarme en el camino yo amado como ama una mujer que el alma no la ha abandonado y que lo intenta un dia mas y que ha sonado con sonar y por amar se ha equivocado y por amar se ha equivocado quizas no habido espacio para ver bastante claro y al final de la jornada tuve que perder si me ha llevado el viento he vivido mis momentos y al final en mi conciencia solo tuve fe y solo por seguir esta locura de la pasion que rapido se esfuma tan

then everybody can be a winner no matter your rag color deep down we all brothers and regardless of the time somebody up there still love us imma scuffle and struggle until im breathless and weak i done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak always keep reaching sure to grab on to something ill be there when you get there waitin with the sounds bumpin you need to loosen up and live a little and if you got kids let them know how you feelin for your own sake give a little oh you dont want to hear that you busy tryina stack and keep up with the joneses takin advantage of your own the realest homies that youve been knowing for the longest but some aint missing a good thing until its gone could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us we prefer to keep our eyes shut till its right when theres something involved that we desire so hold your head up high if yourre poor and righteous i know times seem strife and problems seem endless but at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together and if you feel youre out of the game then you need to get back in it cause nothing worse than a quitter you gotta face responsibility one day my brother so wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition and put your vehicle in drive and stop by my side as we walk down the road of our destiny and the time comes to choose which shall it be the wide and crooked or the straight and narrow we got one voice to give and one life to live stand up for something or lie down in your game listen to the song that we sing its up to you to make it big i guess ill see

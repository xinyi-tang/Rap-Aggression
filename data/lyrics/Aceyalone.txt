your life had been robbed from you and everything that you held close that someone had stolen the woman you loved and that her love was a devils lie that your heart was gone and the best thing that you could do was crawl away and die its the painful cry of a mans despair deep down in his bones i guess misery enjoys company said big bad solomon jones then the stranger turned and his eyes had burned in a most peculiar way and the white t-shirt that was stained in dirt he sat down to watch it sway then his mouth had frowned up in this kind of grin and he spoke in a voice so clear boy you

{'name': 'Junior', 'lyrics': 'yeah yo what up this is aceyalone whats happening yo let me tell you a story real quick about one of my partners about this cat i know one of my homeboys and we just gonna call him junior yeah junior got some money just for being a good kid he sealed it up and never even opened up the lid girls gave him candy cause he treated him nice he took it home and chopped it up and doubled up the price miss thomas at the parents conference said we honest she was astonished at his confidence and what he accomplished he respected his elders but he knew who he liked he listened before he talked and he never would fight its like everybody knew him or they wanted to know him and anytime they did something for him they felt that they owed him he was learning a life game that no one would show him he had more than an idea of where he was going he grew into a young man and gained some trust and he had a knack for pleasing people and that was a plus any situation he was in he would adjust he never cussed and he never fussed what he discussed yeah thats what im talking about we was the same age but i still looked up to him because we had this thing together some people just got that knack and you cant do nothing about it but he ended up being a victim of circumstance because hes on the rise and you know hes gotta battle against the odds and my man had such a good demeanor he was smart man and he was a hustler and he had his   up and he had a natural ability to bring people together and which people he brought together junior had it good junior had it good junior had it good junior had it good by the time he turned 26 he was intense he was becoming a young prince with a whole lot of sense not only could he make money hustling white he had a little bit of everything to get you some height they made cash with him so nobody wanted to hit him but theyd get him if they had to get him get rid of him quick but why kill off the goose if youre making the grip and why kill off the captain if you run a good ship some people are strong some people are weak other are smart but still dont got a stomach for the streets but junior had a different angle he was an angel the calypso changed though the game could tango cause he cant tango or dance with wolves or waltz with a rattlesnake what would it prove they started salting up his program hoping hed lose but he stayed cool and he stayed steady making moves yeah okay meanwhile juniors off doing his thing and living up to his full potential but the haters and i dont even want to call them that cause theyre worse than that but hes become a victim of the monster you know the machine the revolving door its them thats got versus them that cant get and aint gonna never get man four years later junior got him a nice stack compared to what he used to have now hes got twice that when beef is at his door he decided to ice that now knowing more and more he was caught in a mice trap he wanted to fight back but who could he tell the lesser of the two evils would just put him in a cell everybody around knew that junior was frail but he didnt need muscles to make it all he needed was a scale a hundred and twenty-thousand in cold hard cash a stash at gun blast that dont even ask you get beat by the only one thing that can beat you defeat you cheat you the streets will eat you jealousy and envy make a person deceitful then you add greed to it combination is lethal well its a short life knowing that it wont be a sequel sometimes bad things just happen to good people yeah so they killed him they murdered him in cold blood he died face-down in front of an empty safe and for the fools that did this i hope you rot in hell i hope you live in hell for my nigga junior rest in

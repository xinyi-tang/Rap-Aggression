world i can rock this town and when they asked him for his name he said kurtis blow i play the rappin game i can do the do i can do the deed and tonight im gonna rock ganamede now ganamede thought he was cool wore gucci shoes had a fancy school a fancy job in a big corporation fancy girls all across the nation fancy car fancy clothes fancy friends and fancy dough only one thing he wouldnt do is let himself get down with you the stranger went to the old saloon grabbed his mike and spun a tune and everyone in the whole darn place said do the rap and set that pace he rapped em down and he rapped em out he made em dance and he made em shout he said if you like kurtis blow then let me hear you all say a say ho-oo ho-oo hi-yo hi-yo say kurtis kurtis say kurtis blow kurtis blow at midnight ganamede came in to watch the dancers move and spin he took a seat over by the bar and started smokin a big cigar i admit the stranger is not bad but tonight im gonna make him sad cause i dont care about the groove there aint no dude gonna make me move the joint was jumpin hard at one but ganamede was havin none things were really fly at two the stranger rapped and the tension grew but ganamede maintained his cool ill make the stranger play the fool cause i dont care about the groove there aint no dude gonna make me move the showdown came at three oclock the stranger said im gonna make you rock im gonna make you move im gonna make you dance theyre gonna take you out in an ambulance now everybody lend a hand im gonna make you be the band there aint no jive no superstition were gonna have a little demolition get down now stomp your feet to the funky beat just clap your hands and let the beat expand let me here the bass put it in my face let the guitar play just put it away and now i think weve got the groove so ganamede get up and move now everyone looked at the bar at the lonely man with the big cigar he began to move he began to shake hed had as much as he could take he took his body to the floor and then the crowd began to roar the stranger just had done the deed and rocked the house with ganamede from three to four he couldnt stop from four to five he just had to rock from five to six he let it loose at seven he still had the juice at eight oclock he was goin strong gettin down with every song at nine oclock he couldnt dance and someone called an ambulance as they put him in the back of that big white shiny cadillac he said please get me kurtis blow theres something that he ought to know he said i thought id make my name by beatin you at the rappin game but you beat me fair and square and anyway i just dont care the stranger asked him what he meant said ganamede i am content i never used to catch a groove i never used to dance or move but its more fun to play the fool than tryin hard to be real cool so anytime youre back in town im gonna get up and im gonna get down the stranger watched him drive away knowing what hed done that day and then he went right back inside to make the dancers slip and slide to rock em out to rock em in to make em rock it down again and he said if you like my sound let me hear you all say throw down throw down at the

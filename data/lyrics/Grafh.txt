tree that falls in an empty forest and i can hear the sound that it makes it echoes life values  in your face so i always know the way a branch sounds when it breaks i can hear screaming children on the plane before it hit the twin towers in between the building its like i was chilling in between the ceiling its like i was right there where were you i hear the last cries of a new born widow hearin the words i love you for the last time i remember seeing my pops for the last time he aint tell me he loved me neither or hugged me either but trust me its deeper than a man could take it he died before he ever got the chance to say it the world had to take him away by the can they sprayin have you ever held the hands of a man decaying sometimes i wait for him to come home im mad patient ive never been to his grave so i never had to face it he never got to know me we never got to make it or finished making our bond so we never got to break it the only time we bonded when we talked about sports instead of saying i love you we just talked about the stars so i started watching the game and talk about them all but after he died i aint watch it no more hook nobody told me or showed me or told me nobody told me that life would be hard nobody told me or showed or told me nobody told me how to hide them scars and nobody told me or showed me or told me you could be in love but inside you are lonely nobody told me or showed me or told me when youre dying inside that life goes on and on and on verse 2 i hear shots from the tec bursting when the muscles rip i can smell flesh burning its a living nightmare when i close my eyes he still sitting right there right beside fear right beside my pride but inside im still scared but if i cry and wipe my eyes i can never dry the tears and i can still see each of them shots reach him and i can still see the gun i can still see breath leave the lungs of a man trying to scream and my grandma screamed at the police saying hes my son his dead eyes looking at me saying hes my son my shining star hes my son my boy i look in his eyes and i see myself hes like me hes what im like when i be myself a man died with his hands in his pockets standing and watching this man saw the hammer so he ran and he got it right in his back like that  popping i looked right across the street to the man that shot him so how do i stop the pain when its so dark out with no dark clouds how do i stop the rain how come i never cry and i do not complain you aint understand cuz you and i arent the same hey hey hey hook nobody told me or showed me or told me nobody told me that life would be hard nobody told me or showed or told me nobody told me how to hide them scars and nobody told me or showed me or told me you could be in love but inside you are lonely nobody told me or showed me or told me when youre dying inside that life goes on and on and on verse 3 nobody wanna feel rejected you want love nobody wanna feel neglected if you lost somebody maybe youd feel the message life is short you got real feelings express it dont be afraid to express emotion dont be like me i only express when im smoking i dont get to tell them or show

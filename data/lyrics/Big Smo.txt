got an old jar from a masons box i wrote my name on the front and poked a slot in the top and dropped in that first penny watched it rattle around and everywhere that i went i kept my eyes to the ground for a nickel dime dollar working for my papa farm chores paid more as it got hotter either bush hoggin the field or haulin some hay i would weed the whole garden for a full days pay and my daddy taught me that if you earned your way it will mean more to you when you spend it some day keep saving up your change never throw it away fill your jar to the top and put it somewhere safe welcome to my life in a jar it sure has takin me so far from the coins i collected to the grains we selected to the plants out behind the barn its my life in a jar now as i got older my method got

state to state plus the soil was as rich as our aspirations got the right seeds and started cultivating patiently waiting with daily preparation and inch by inch we would reach out destination twelve feet tall like a cedar bush sweet skunk crossbread with that og kush it was prime to push and the block was right and once again we filled the jars and put the lids on tight we was ground shipping through them big brown trucks and we knew that it was risky but we pushed our luck boxed and ducted sealed with a secret touch i put my life in these jars just to earn a buck i keep living my life in a jar it sure has takin me so far from the coins i collected to the grains we selected to the plants out behind the barn its my life in a jar yeah thats right just collecting money as a kid earning a

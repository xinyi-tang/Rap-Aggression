To make changes to the master repo:
> git pull origin master
This is to make sure that there is no merge conflict (merging is when you merge your local repository to the master repositry)
Then, if there is no conflict:
> git add .
This is just saying, "Add every file in my local repository to the files that I want to push"
> git commit -m "insert message here"
This is to commit your files to be added with a message saying what you are about to change. Note that you have not added anything to the 
master repo yet.
Finally,:
> git push origin master

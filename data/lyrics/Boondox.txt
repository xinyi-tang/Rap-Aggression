words no sound from her precious lips she reached and touched me softly with her broken bloody fingertips the tears fell and reality was sinking in in utter shock and disbelief at this unforgiven sin the smell of death like a reminder echoes through the walls knowing that she sits all alone down those darkened halls i want to hold her touch her lay beside her never leave but the sadness on her face will never let it ever be and so she sits and stares just waiting for her final breath a mix of love and broken heart wishing for her death and on this night i sit here waiting for the end when i can walk those darkened halls and be with her again she lies awake for days in misery no one to hold her close or give her what she really needs i know i want to see here be with her all throught the

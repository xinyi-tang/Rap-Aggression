without a purpose put my thoughts upon a page so i could try and prove him wrong and every time i write a song i reminisce about the pain that im repressing in my brain so i dont ever feel alone and ive been living with depression so i wonder how this shit really begins im comfortable with the thoughts of vision and now it is ive been working on this record for a minute still i feel like nothing that i do is good enough my insecurities are creeping in so they would seep in to the music aint it funny when other people see your pain as amusing abusing many a pill and numbing the way i feel til the point of my realitys the furthest thing from real the only thing i ever needed was a little piece of love and i couldnt find that in people so i would seek it in drugs and i wanted to be the greatest instead im facing the truth but the fact of the matter is that im losing it whats the use and i know im sounding repetitive lack the lust for living i pray that i be forgiven  i say lets take a picture for sinners to get the sentiment a critical acclaim to explaining it wasnt evident a premonition of my early death ill make it prevalent malevolent confessing and if i was down and out i cant sell my soul to be relevant gallivanting around like fuck im finally free im ignoring all of my problems i said id bury them deep  but im actually terrified and my paranoia was verified cause i just realized i dont wanna make it to twenty-five a suicidal psychopath a schizophrenic kinda guy thats looking for your empathy hoping that youll remember me the message i provided collided within the melody a metamorphosism reliving giving debauchery the resurrection of a savior coming out of nazareth where you could catch a laceration and a crucifixion under what condition dyou make the decision moving like its in a mild position living at the bottom wishing i was with it couldnt tell the difference so tired of giving the false opinions my faith in the book that was written by other people they probably wrote with agendas so every role was intended for anyone to follow attention i got a testament just like the book of mark im sparking a revolution my story a revelation amazing id rather save it debate it everything on my mind while i was taking a mental picture ok so my train of thought is evasive im faded within my memory from a daily addiction of always staying sedated and claiming i wanna make it im nothing more than a follower no apologies for it enforcing my fucking happiness dont know what i believe and im seething and barely breathing i was thinking of positivity the possibility that ill be sane is like a fallacy i got a way to go and im showing you people gradually i been imagining a better life and then i contradict it the consequence of feeling like a loser with no confidence and ive been all alone im tryna find the source of inner peace i suffocate the beat until the flow has been consumed i strangulate that mother fucker turn the tune and turn the night maroon and if im being honest i think im losing my passion im passing on opportunities giving in to distraction the problems that ive been having is all of its a facade its quantity over quality profit over the product but shit if it makes a dollar who gives a fuck if its garbage well get it radio play and then now make it a classic and take a nigga with talent thats about as big as a grain of salt and put him on a pedestal hell eventually catapult to perpetual force the actual result distracting they forgot that mother fucker was never decent at rapping they reminisce on the past and there aint nobody original but niggas stealing styles and never giving their credit accepting that shits pathetic a hypothetical pondering i put it on a paper for some people im being honest with abolishing a novice and murdering his accomplice a complicated affair with the notorious hitter these habitual liars supplying a lot of ignorance its all about an image so everyones irresponsible and if you got a positive message then its impossible to overcome the current plan and rap a better obstacle its illogical to think that the future is looking brighter when money comes into play than the vision will get distorted cause you were forced into feeling by acting out of your character you lost your sense of pride thats inside dont let them embarrass ya barely making it now when youre coming up from the rubble refuse to be in the rut aint no need for an introduction my shit is really disgusting its different and impeccable intelligent and highly respectable youre susceptible to this lyrical giant a tyrant acting defiant id rather do this alone so mother fuck an alliance aligning with preservation to practice my dedication by defecating the delicate relegated with delegates to give them rigamortis supported within a deficit celebrated a reverence televising my decadence from years of destitution the resolutions irrelevant its gotten to the point where i can see that nothings real at all its leaving me appalled and im embarrassed i will get involved to mental regression for i have yet to evolve got to find a spot to put my aggression before im gone but the pain that i feel has lasted so long so by the end of this song im praying for my desire cause im refusing to fake it id rather reform than retire so my generation remedial i really cant believe this shit is happening in any lie im surrounded by fucking geniuses and you gotta be kidding me the only thing i was meant to be is the dopest mother fucker that people will probably never see and if i never make it then im fulfilling the prophecy everything that i write has been centered around my honesty'}, {'name': 'Illumination', 'lyrics': 'stop wondering how i do it i am the dopest i thought that you knew this and i never fabricate id rather concentrate writing these records till my fingers blister the picture im painting the vivid description the vision lyricism niggas i written i rose from the rubble youll never surpass it the phoenix that flew with the truth of the masses im a get inside of you mother fucker regurgitated people lookin at me like you really want it elevated never hesitated take my brain out while i meditated i was highly medicated save your reservation for another cadence you could try to keep up with the pace you could try to keep up with the pace if you put me in the cypher with niggas im out of place i murder an instrumental turn it into fragments spittin the fast raps a mother fucking distraction i cultivate a different sound that i would give em just a little mother fucker that was coming out of maryland captivate them with lyrics i guarantee i embarrass them and take them on a ride make sure they feeling the vibe my flow is really alive and you was lookin surprised at the way this mother fucker would make a rhythm collide it was difficult depending on the way that i say it and what a nigga displaying i bet i make a statement i was caught up in a vision of giving cause i was reliving now give me your fucking minute so people can feel this sentence i kill em with kinaesthetics while keepin it copacetic but niggas are prototypical people fake as prosthetics and ill probably never get it i swear to god that im honest the definition of truthful the proof is in my composure plus i got a couple mother fucking bodies in the closet with a new noose hanging from the ceiling reveling i was alone for a while as a child i would live inside my isolation my self preservations amazing on several occasions i cant do a somber conclusion that lies in illusion confusing the way that i view it is darker than you and yo kids so keep with the tempo by giving you maximum size of info i pray im forgivin for sins before i go never been the same see i been a nigga thats giving effort that you would never forget and you was quick to expect this mother fucker to talk about some ignorance a diamond color chain its a pain when the colors change when its glistenin so now i got you motherfuckers listenin positionin  with my intentions of interjectin if i ever make it then realism is in effect i give an intermission the vision for what you lack and its actual fucking content dont you have a conscience shit that i provided was similar to an antidote my educated guess is impressin and im proffesin that i was given the prominence complements of the most high a salaam aleikum aleikum salaam for the nigga with the bowtie what is a material im ready for the afterlife i got it in with destiny my ridiculous appetite i hate that mother fucker you probably wouldnt believe it the beat is leakin a liter when ever that nigga is speakin i said that my shits egregious the legacy i was leaving im feeling it from my sanity sacrifing on my inhibition you know that im abusin i wouldnt ever retrieve it you know that i could proceed ya got the existential feeling they want it from the beginning i try to make it apparent they wanna focus up on appearance and what a nigga was wearing apparent never your being that mother fuckers were giving and i was living to die i wanted to make a masterpiece im working like a starving artist departed from fallacies im feeling like a mental patient my life is insanity they put me on a pill to differentiate a fantasy from actual reality self esteem is a casualty im acting so erratically imagining a life i know that i could never lead and im encompassing everything that you should never be cause you fell in love with the melody while ignoring the message the undertone of the reckoning is really reactionary it varies upon the words and the people that i would say it too defending you to try and free your mind is what im finna do my vision wasnt miniscule and when you at the bottom is when the personll ridicule i pray it never gets to you i promise if you keep it cool and stay composed and everything you do will have a better view but thats if your intentions were honest from the beginning when you do it for the love and you never receive a penny and people just see the product and follow  automatically assume that your money is on boom and find the prodigal son and i get the crucifixion resurrected on the seventh day i need a fucking witness they could document it and show you i was legendary ive been feeling like a god repentance is necessary lord fuck with it ill just talk a bunch of random shit i dont give a fuck laughs abstract art download that shit if you havent yet its not out now while were recording this its gonna be out by the time were done recording

dope as fuck and people tell you it you need to be a man and start asserting all your confidence youre fucking 24 and you still cant accept a compliment you need to make a change but i know im stating the obvious and i wanna be better but its never that easy very vivid depiction of pictures that ive been painting i promise youll feel my pain in a second so ill explain cause a couple years ago i couldnt even find a friend to call and now you hit me up like im really loving your record dawg and people never listen im speaking bout being restless i say im cutting my wrists and you telling me that its dope i know you praying that i blow so we can all get rich and if you make it you can take me with you man that would be it cause ive been down from the beginning boy i knew you was the shit

target i am a martian fuck all the yelling and barking planning and talking you know that what im embarking on is definitely tedious maybe its devious i do not care i know that im leaving with all of his cash a chain in the wallet no way you can stop me the profit is all that i see im running your pockets you better believe im doing it out of necessity not necessarily what the fuck you thought it was and with her consumption of drugs has made it impossible for my mother to show me any love shes coming and going whenever she pleases even though i really need her now im conceded no one really

fuck this forgiveness why am i feeling vindictive i gotta deal with my issues i should get rid of the pistol shouldnt be in this position fuck it im already here i made up my mind the thought is defined i see him picking up his pace and his movement is getting eratic and i will not have it but if i shoot a shot and miss in the shadows of those thats in front of him i guess that that will cause havoc ecstatic the perfect distraction pick up the pistol and blast i laugh now i can see through all the madness people are running and screaming and my tunnel vision is centering upon the

misery nobody listens i was a victim my circumstances counting my losses taking some chances never given an advantage i was just living without any plan and you understand that i will take nothing for granted finally come to the end i feel like they found me and if they did i told myself that i will never die sober i am a soldier sparking the blunt that i had in my pocket so that i can think open

clean lost so much time tryna focus on the pipe now you wanna be a father to your kids alright and my older brothers  no time for looking back rather get it by himself yelling mutherfuck dad heading for the front door that was an obvious fact and the pain that my older brother was feeling was real but there aint no way to cope when you couldnt even deal and he was feeling abandoned stranded

really think its that confusing cuz at this point its ammusing i try to break it down in a way youll understand im now in the process of becoming a man what i learned from my father was never really taught mouth closed eyes wide to observe and to watch but within that time i saw what not to be and i know i can never leave with hypocrisies i prefer to write a record bout everything that i seen and

start a thousand miles and poles apart where worlds collide and days are dark you may have my number you can take my name but youll never have my heart if the sky falls when it crumbles we will stand tall and face it all together let the skyyyy when it crumbles we will stand tall and face it all together at skyfall let the sky fall when it crumbles we will stand tall where you go i go what you see i see i know ill never be me without the security on your loving arms keeping me from harm put my hand in your hand and well stand let the skyfall lord knows i aint ready for tomorrow never been a nigga that was really prepared and i was honestly scared terrified of the dark side suicidal mind my demise never televised when i realize i got a reason to live like making a hit or fucking a bitch and pushing the whip copping the chain the diamonds insane make sure they can see a mother fucker doing his thing lord switch it up dumb it down dont nobody understand the what the fuck that you even saying when you get up on the track you spitting it at fast speeds indeed back back i need a second to think im lost in my thoughts my soul is diluted i hope that you feeling the rhythm as i use to it to my advantage no more excuses those things are useless ill execute with the effort of a person dying to get a shot no shock keep it down his last dime taking the time to re-define this nigga is dedicated he elevated is wrath i still remember every time they laugh and i reflect on the pain and put it upon the past know what type of shit is that i could never relax when i recall that somebody told me i would never make it as an artist probably end up starving i took that hate said fuck it and kept barging my life is in the margin giving it regardless i got a story to tell havent even begun to sit and reflect or rewind on the memories that were repressed and thats due to the fact that im living on the edge dont know how to get ahead with a blade to my wrist waiting for this shit to end

keep this minimal i used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns and like riflery champs fellas start to get amped dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so i gave it some thought remembering the brothers who are gone now i will make a strong vow to make things right ignite the mic get hype and all that suckers try to menace but they always fall flat to the ground as i astound come around ill put you down about the brothers who think theyre boss think theyre getting large but in the end they pay the cost of their lives and that

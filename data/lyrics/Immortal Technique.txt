day gangsters immobile army they wanna move us all out the nyc like they did to the jews with the alhambra decree so support your own businesses and do the knowledge cause the real harlem renaissance is economic when they were saying it is the renaissance of harlem they didnt mean that we had stake in that they meant to say that they could make money out of us they are coming in with all kinds of prejudices in brooklyn theyre doing the same thing in queens theyre doing the same thing the bronx theres hardly any place which is affordable i mean those people are putting up condominiums which start from a million dollars how many people in this community make that kind of money how many people have that kind of money people of harlem they are the natural allies of the oppressed people of

before you die'}, {'name': 'Open Your Eyes', 'lyrics': 'were here because of you were here because you were there weve arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of america we were promised a better life in our home countries where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury some corporations are more efficient than government but their motivation is not the health or the well-being of the people its only about profit everything else--their image their human resources their public relations--only exist to protect the reality behind it once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us and so they privatized everything everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture by those who never had our interests at heart they didnt care about our survival or well-being--they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land by exploiting our people our industry and our resources they took everything we built and made it theirs first by creating racism to justify slavery building the capital for capitalism and then when they gave us what they call liberty everything we had was still owned by them our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy and that we would have freedom but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own god open your eyes before you die and while some used missionaries and donations to off-set this abuse other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes using war disease and sanctions that killed millions they supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people because their loyalty was to those who enabled them restored them and kept them in power they became the bastard children of american industry kleptocracy governments of thievery they protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits the puppet rulers were given billions of us tax dollars to fund civil wars right wing death squads execute political dissidents sympathetic clergy and even overthrow democratically elected governments and so the age of revolution began again they painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market but the free market has never been free because the market does not regulate itself it is manipulated like a puppet and it survives because of its image destroy the image and the enemy will die such is the same in the rap industry but the major label super powers treat the underground like the third world when they need new assets new artists to prostitute a side-ins and put on a shelf to use their songs when they needed new concepts music and publishing to steal from the producers they came to the underground to the third world they took our culture our property and our industry and our resources even using our own people to help them exploit us but behind the mask of efficiency they claimed that we need them to succeed theyre no better than us their economic advertising was always a lie a few got rich but most were given an illusion of wealth almost as if it was designed for failure opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture glittering rented jewelry the cars the imf loans the seeds with suicide jeans 20-year contracts and oil blood money build your defenses my independent brothers and sisters theyll stop at nothing to get what they want they paint the third world underground as savage and backward but the super powers are no less corrupt theyve just learned to disguise it better cause they fix elections too they embezzle tax money they go to war for resources they fund terrorism for their own benefit and when theres enough at stake historys taught us that theyll even assassinate their own president wake up just as the columbia represents mans highest aspirations in the field of science so too does the struggle of the afghan people represent mans highest aspiration

because you afraid to be lonely and when you come back its too late so you overcompensate like victims of rape full of self-hate lost in the affection to strangers around you instead of the only

tried to crawl back in my life unexpectedly these are my indictments of those who claim to be righteous and leave a trail of broken hearts on their way to enlightment but i cant give into hatred or pass judgment even towards every illusion ive been in love with cause the heart that betrays itself willingly is like a nation that trades freedom for stability its so seductive to be cold and corrupted and isolated and try to be an independent republic but liberty to be loved on the surface is worthless the sacrifice of revolution with no purpose take it from a criminal searching for his

'Dance With the Devil', 'lyrics': 'i once knew a nigga whose real name was william his primary concern was makin a million bein the illest hustler that the world ever seen he used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams a corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend she put the pipe down but for every year she was sober her sons heart simultaneously grew colder he started hangin out sellin bags in the projects checkin the young chicks lookin for hit-and-run prospects he was fascinated by material objects but he understood money never bought respect he built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal but got locked once and didnt hesitate to squeal so criminals he chilled with didnt think he was real you see me and niggas like this have never been equal i dont project my insecurities in other people he fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil a feeble-minded young man with infinite potential the product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed dancin with the devil smoked until his eyes would bleed but he was sick of sellin trees and gave in to his greed everyone tryin to be trife never face the consequences you probably only did a month for minor offenses ask a nigga doin life if he had another chance but then again theres always the wicked that knew in advance dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block but thats what happens when you rape murder and sell rock devils used to be gods angels that fell from the top theres no diversity because were burnin in the melting pot so billy started robbin niggas anything he could do to get his respect back in the eyes of his crew startin fights over little shit up on the block stepped up to sellin mothers and brothers the crack rock workin overtime for makin money for the crack spot hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine fulfillin the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain tired of the block niggas treatin him the same he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs but when he tried to step to em niggas showed him no love they told him any motherfuckin coward can sell drugs any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood even puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club but only a real thug can stab someone til they die standin in front of them starin straight into their eyes billy realized that these men were well-guarded and they wanted to test him before business started suggested rapin a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted so now he had a choice between goin back to his life or makin money with made men up in the cyph his dreams about cars and ice made him agree a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three everyone tryin to be trife never face the consequences you probably only did a month for minor offenses ask a nigga doin life if he had another chance but then again theres always the wicked that knew in advance dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block but thats what happens when you rape murder and sell rock devils used to be gods angels that fell from the top theres no diversity because were burnin in the melting pot they drove around the projects slow while it was rainin smokin blunts drinkin and jokin for entertainment until they saw a woman on the street walkin alone three in the mornin comin back from work on her way home and so they quietly got out the car and followed her walkin through the projects the darkness swallowed her they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw so billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground screamin shut the fuck up and stop movin around the shirt covered her face but she screamed and clawed so billy stomped on the bitch until hed broken her jaw the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin blood leakin through the cloth she cried silently and then they all proceeded to rape her violently billy was made to go first but each of them took a turn rippin her up and chokin her until her throat burned her broken jaw mumbled for god but they werent concerned when they were done and she was lyin bloody broken and bruised one of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two they told him that she was a witness of what shed gone through and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew he thought about it for a minute she was practically dead and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head im fallin and i cant turn back im fallin and i cant turn back right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life he thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice and he felt strong standin along with his new brothers cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover but what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter cause he was starin into the eyes of his own mother she looked back at him and cried cause he had forsaken her she cried more painfully than when they were rapin her his whole world stopped he couldnt even contemplate his corruption had successfully changed his fate and he remembered how his mom used to come home late workin hard for nothin because now what was he worth he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth and cryin out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared but only the devil responded cause god wasnt there and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul they say death takes you to a better place but i doubt it after that they killed his mother and never spoke about it and listen cause the story that im tellin is true cause i was there with billy jacobs and i raped his mom too and now the devil follows me everywhere that i go in fact

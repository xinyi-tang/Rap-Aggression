he said very soon every american will be required to register their biological property in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging by such methodology we can compel people to submit to our agenda which will effect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency every american will be forced to register or suffer being unable to work and earn a living they will be our chattel and we will hold the security interest over them forever by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions americans by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent forever to remain economic slaves through taxation secured by their pledges they will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and if by accident one or two should figure it out we have in our arsenal plausible deniability after all this is the only logical way to fund government by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges this will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every american a contributor to this fraud which we will call social insurance without realizing it every american will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner every american will unknowingly be our servant however begrudgingly the people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption and we will employ the high office of the president of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against america'}, {'name': 'Terrorist Threats (feat.

a knife to his wrist contemplating if life made sense see he just quit his job sick of flipping burgers and living in the garage so he just let it ring didnt even check the caller id thought about his girlfriend cheating on him he caught her in the bed with another woman and another man couldnt understand how you can crush a persons heart in the palm of your hands now hes depressed even thinking suicidal like how you go from a lover to a rival bottle of jack knife on his lap death on his mind matter of time before he just snaps but he answers the phone its his mother on the other end pleading that he needs to come home he puts the knife down at the sound of her voice hesitant about making that choice wrong or right that phone call might have saved his life he said to himself she couldve been his wife he couldve been her husband couldve had a family wonder where the love went what caused her to be unfaithful was it him or the young stud that she met at the gym always kept a smile knew how to pretend never thought his life might come to an end she reflects on the days when they were best friends but this is now and that was then she awakes to the news he committed suicide her heart drops and she begins to cry thinking of their first kiss back in junior high didnt even get the chance to say goodbye but its because of her hes no longer alive worst part about it he never knew why

you show it they will use it its the code of the hustler talkin to each other sayin we gonna get that buster they dont respect you but they keep smilin in your face they wanna taste how you livin and the money you gettin they smell the fear and they wait for you to make a mistake then they infiltrate and take every last bit of your cake so if you livin in the fast lane look in your mirrors cause the dramas much closer than the objects appear if you slip one time they might end you that minute and everything that you worked for is gone in seconds then you see a light and you keep on gettin

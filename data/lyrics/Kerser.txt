kid lives rap taking every opportunity no time to sit back no money in the bank so he gets to the breaks no doing it to rap its to get off his face whats more important man his visions distorted and there isnt a warning he just leaves without caution he drops a tape now he kind of got a local buzz a couple heads in the scene check he knows whats up some enemies changed they wanna be mates but his eyes on the dream he aint dealing with fakes nah he meets the scene and gathers most the cunts are fake as makes his own path while his older brother makes tracks he steps to battles man hes serving em up and he aint even fucking notice cause hes swerving on drugs but his buzz getting bigger labels turn and ignore but that aint gonna keep him down cause hes burning for sure at a show hes selling tapes gives out one for free the best choice he ever made cause the cunt got beats and at the time he didnt know it but his chances of failure dropped cause hes with one of the best in australia when it comes to making beats so the lad is excited fan base on the rise and the rappings are tightest he got his sound and the album was lethal got a different reaction out of some of his people from fans to mates say hes not the same but the last seven years feel like a couple of days go get fucked that hes changed man he knows who he is a couple beats flipped now you gonna say hes a bitch but he doesnt really care cause the fans are screaming yeah and the lights in his eyes feels like a dream there the main plan is officially in motion any second now he sees his dream and hes approaching and

of her house cause of his poor grades he left right out that door straight worse than before made money on the streets with elites in no time theres receipts from leather seats and fleets rolling sweets and tucking heat since that metals been on the cop providing its like riding a bike then catch you with your chain slipping pedalling on the block bang bang bang he finds himself inside a shootout with some rival crew thinking bout survival through traffic speeding while bleeding its graphic blood leaking more than an ounce shit at 16 hours before his daughters birth he was pronounced

down on her first night in the back of a crown vic as them sounds kick nauseated moving around sick to her stomach missing class kissing ass to make up a test with the study listen pass with flying colors always evil eyeing brothers since her baby father dont claim her child and probably denying others at first you thought i dont need him ill just give him his freedom til she finds out a girl knows him thats who she buys her weed from she was told that he slangs with his cousin dealing what she thought dylan was his name that she wasnt feeling so she made a call got some young wild niggas

listening and ah i dont want to freak you out or anything but ah i really need your help and i i got explain myself okay you hear me hello hello is anyone out there im just hoping you can hear me im by myself all alone and nearly on the verge of breaking down like every single track and this very instrumental that was meant to make a sound im not sure if what ima tell you you heard before but if so im probably saying it wrong cause if i wasnt then maybe you wouldnt unintentionally play me every time that you were playing a song you mightve thought the same thing if your mind kept playing tricks on you but you and i know you still think this is a concept like i aint talking to you yeah you whos listening when are you going to wake up so youre not repeating this again you just sitting and standing there like you always do and might not even play this all way through i know when you dont and when you do youre not taking me serious maybe youre talking over me or turn the volume down or cut me off mid-sentence im painstakingly furious you could be asleep but you need you brain awake to be curious cause im really here on the other side of your speaker and whats standing between us is some wires and a tweeter if you found something to crack it open maybe i could climb through and leave this track that i shouldnt have wrote a rhyme to cause i cant explain it but i think thats how i got here i heard this beat put it on repeat and copped a squat near the speaker and zoned out blazing the ganja jotting about two lines literally writing one behind another so suddenly my eyes crossed and then blurred i was at a loss for words when i got lost in the words i got choked by the letter o but dotted all the is so i had to cross the ts when we became the same size i kicked the first line in the verse back and it indents so now im chased by this run-on sentence i ran so fast i leaped from the page thats when the paper split then i closed my notebook shut tried to escape this shit so what you think about me sliding through the crack hope you nodding in agreeance and not nodding to the track hello excuse me are you still there if so im not for sure if that you ever will care in fact i never know and that just doesnt feel fair but i dont want you to go so hello are you still there well if the music still playing i might as well try to finish up what im saying while laying on my ass from falling fast from the mayhem out my book i looked damn im missing a shoe it might have been trapped in the beat that i was listening to cause it was dark and i aint know what direction to walk towards i took a couple steps and stumbled over some chords plugged em in to each other so when they were combined it created this white noise thats how i saw the drumline i seen it hid behind the bass in the mix so i found some strings went over there and got the lace in the kicks i tried em on and they fit perfect then i grabbed the hi-hat put it on top of my head let it sit swerved into the left you know how i do it look cool to me then slip my finger through the loop like it was jewelry im sure that youll agree about how the instruments was stacked too i probably could have took this track and made a tracksuit that wouldve made the look complete had i pulled it off but all that rearranging mustve got the beat mad since certain sounds were out of place so now im clashing with symbols while trying not to get beaten by the bass hold up i hope you still following me and i dont lose you so ima try to keep this story short cause i refuse to i picked my book up ran without making any stops i cut through the chops and hopped over the drops im thinking what if i can write myself up out of here so i decided to look in the book while flipping through the pages for empty paper this punchline punched me and i caught a right hook from a hook it laid me out over the beat like some vocals i woke up and ive been here ever since you need more evidence hello hope you aint leave the room- hello hello excuse me are you still there if so im not for sure if that you ever will care in fact i never know and that just doesnt feel fair but i dont want you to go so hello are you still there aye are you still there aye the song about to go off man can you get me out of here please man cmon man i gotta wait till you play this again cmon dog damn dialing phone number now i gotta call this shit again damn hate this man shouldve never smoked with fess  good morning youre tuned into am hotline amen it is saturday the twenty-first sh- please dont let em call tan man

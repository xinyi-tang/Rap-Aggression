is taking over town i did not understand the motive of the seductress cause i remembered when she murdered truth and justice now heres where the situation gets complex if i take ignorance down would the prophet be next i remember the words of wisdom so i answered with note then she informs me that im poisoned and she has the antidote i flew into a rage and started flipping shit over seduction held her ground keeping her composure she said youre wasting time fucking with me you had 24 hours now you have 23 hello seduction did the prophet take the bait oh he did did he for your sake i hope

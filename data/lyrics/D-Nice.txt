hanging in the middle but now if youre puzzled let me kick the whole riddle that my name is derrick and if i didnt mention d-nice is just a description it describes the kid on the mic im the tr-808 huh but just call me d-nice my name is d nice take ta-take taking out you suckers and you dont know how i did it i start to think a very big conscious all around me who will be the sucker mc to try to doubt me is it you or you or you or you or him but im like a tree and every lyric is a limb you throw it on the turntable very unstable but you gamble because you need that example theres a 1000 mcs on the planet earth now what is the word you say to get hers some like to explain some talk educated some like mcboo hes x-rated i like to think of myself as a pure rebel a radical thinker on a musical level cause suckers want to stop me and girls want to kiss wherever i go yo it seems i cant be dissed cause my name is d-nice but all the girls call me derrick it ran through my crew so i guess ive inherit the job of explaining and also retaining the fact d-nice is remaining not a king nor a prince but as a teacher with dope beats like this i know im gonna reach ya so now i dont think you should all despise this fact d-nice is on a rise straight to the top like a bubble of water its a slaughter so i think you oughta think realistically not egotistically its suicide if you even

and more about peace about wars about whores breaking city laws to me become a chore i wear no jeri curls but i still pull girls i dont slur my words when i rap cause thats wack huh but in fact i do not slack when i drop the funky funky lyric on a track im not conceited when i walk the streets and you can tell by the words that i speak that im not just another brother on the mic cause the females love me and they call me d-nice'}, {'name': 'Glory', 'lyrics': 'when they gon give us the blue suits back in the civil war days of 1863 was the year that free blacks would try to adapt as soldiers

to his partner curt he didnt realize what he was in for and all stan wanted to make was a few dollars more a few dollars more is what he started to make now hes drivin around a saab with a house upstate he got gold and diamond rings crazy girls and all those glamorous things but one day this life-style end when one afternoon while hangin with a friend sittin in the park drinkin quarts of beer and somebody said throw your hands in the air its a stick-up and put the gun to his head and said make another move and youre dead now stan had to make is choice he paused and said i recognize that voice huh where have i heard this now he remember its his man named curtis curtis is mad and felt hed been robbed cause stan is drivin around in his saab he looked at stan and said i cant believe him now its time for me to get even stan made a move real quick curt jumped back and said yo thats it shot him in the back of his head with a nine reached in his pocket grabbed his cash and then dashed

committed his life to a interracial bride yes he did rise days after he died god of the oppressed even in it he still thrives died as a criminal from the hood part of town what can i say yes he is god

that we create in order to determine how the polset the people will live together on this land its a political construct whats real is ethnicity whats real is the people groups who move through time in space and land and are shaped by their experiences together so i would argue we need to reclaim ethnicity yeah he is the messiah and that what is prioritized and that these are the categories that

white man religion european invention to drive the weak to submission how can an african like me get the vision when these preachers owned slaves but taught that freedom was christian christ of the culture christ to the vultures committed genocide with a cross and a holster christ of america christ of the system that is not my savior thats a politician christ that the lord knows christ that was foretold christ thats sure to come back in his war clothes which christ do you believe you gotta know before you leave yes he did arrive yes he was alive brown middle eastern definitely wasnt white no he never married he never had any wives but committed his life to a interracial bride yes he did rise days after he died god of the oppressed even in it he still thrives died as a criminal from the

his own image da vinci returned the favor but he is still risen he is still risen he is still risen over the guns and supremacists over all the division over the wicked intentions the real one is

claim them christ that the lord knows christ that was foretold christ thats sure to come back in his war clothes which christ do you believe you gotta know before you leave lets leave now the thing i would argue is that race isnt even real its something that we create in order to determine how the polset the people will live together on this land its a political construct whats real is ethnicity whats real is the people groups who move through time in space and land and are shaped by their experiences together so i would argue we need to reclaim ethnicity yeah he is the messiah and that what is prioritized and that these are the categories that we have to work with but jesus doesnt sit nicely and neatly with our categories and scripture tells us clearly if you are human you are created in

got the news i had nothin to share i just wanted to be there for you weep please use my shirt we plead til our eyes hurt look we aint gotta speak well be bleak please itll be fine son the doctor said head is barely operable its got your brain lobe and when they go in here its gotta go when youre awake walkin and talkin will be an obstacle its hard to feel hope writin your will at 27 years old but you never said im too young for this not a mumblin grumblin word on your tongue and lips like god why lift up your chin and pump your fist like all these years of lovin him and this is what i get you know i had to cry lookin in your eyes you said in your life or death christ will be glorified this muscle in my chest is broken leakin but im in jesus but somethings underneath it a heart that never stops beatin underneath these broken pieces theres a heart that never stops when you feel your life is bleedin theres a heart that never stops that never stops beatin i wish i couldve been there when she found it was surgical that the thing affectin her airports was terminal i could see the devastation on her parents faces your baby girl has a bad heart and it needs replacement born this way we cant medicate it somebody has to die with a good heart then well exchange it some sort of substitute or she wont survive john q in real time she needs a savior but she had one at 14 it went down heart transplant so this one would be the second round but this procedure isnt near as crucial as the first cause this new heart will stop beatin even if it works she didnt dwell on all the stuff that she would never be if i dont get picked from this list eternal joys ahead of me the nurse said shes in denial thats why she keeps a smile no she hoped to god and the donor came at the right time thats why you hear her singin now underneath these broken pieces theres a heart that never stops when you feel your life is bleedin theres a heart that never stops never stops beatin i might not know what the answer is but i know what the answer isnt it cant be that he doesnt care or hes nonexistent sufferins a problem and why many are rejectin god but just cause you dont know the answer doesnt mean there isnt one what if gods plan for pain isnt for you to skip it we need the nightmare to appreciate not bein in it deeper the pain deeper the game upon its endin plus god will take our pain so serious he joined us in it jesus suffered like none other when he was on the cross why do the good die that only happened once but the good rise but not for good guys he gives new hearts and eternal life to the ones who should die he gives our pain purpose this is not in vain we endure in joy for the end joy of seein his face itll all make sense then years of sufferin made up for in an instant this may be the last breath that i take but its okay its fine by me oh if for some reason im not here when you wake its okay im where i need to be oh the average life span of a heart transplant is 10-15 years my dear sister jasmine is on year 11 and as i get to know her the more i find out no matter what happens she has a heart that will never stop beating i love it yeah'}, {'name': 'Angels', 'lyrics': 'got a

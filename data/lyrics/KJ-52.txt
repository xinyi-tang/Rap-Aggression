see i only wanted to share with you now what jesus done for me but theres a whole nother side to things now that i come to see its a huge influence you got upon on the industry but enough of me cause its not what i came to say to you not a day goes by where i dont take time to pray for you im sorry now for what your mom and dad they did to you but i can relate with you cause well see dude ive been

his way to the spot a man from upstairs told him to stop and come here and he just stared at this little boy of seven years with brown hair and as he came near the man whispered in his ear what he said left him numb frozen with fear he wanted to run but his feet wouldnt go anywhere he wanted to scream but he couldnt he was glued there he wanted to leave but he wouldnt he was too scared cry no more you dont have to cry no more dont cry no more you dont have to cry no more what happened that day left him changed forever a day he wished he could erase and never remember he tried to block out the pain as he got older but he was consumed with hate now for this neighbor and everyday he was ashamed when he saw himself so ashamed that he proclaimed that he would never tell blocked out the memory of the pain so hed never feel hed pretend to be okay and hide in his shell hed try to put a smile on his face like all was well but this child couldnt change what he really felt he blamed god for the cards that he was dealt his heart grew hard by the time he was twelve began to fall apart and his grades start to fail until the day he cried to god asking for his help he wanted to find and start a new life for himself he closed his eyes and into the arms of christ he fell cry no more you dont have to cry no more dont cry no more you dont have to cry no more everything you heard the boy would never speak he held it all inside until he turned fifteen i know that might be hard for you to believe but he couldnt talk about it until god set me free see way back when he was seven years old he was sexually abused but no one was ever told with nowhere to turn and no place to go see he thought he could get through and maintain control but little did he know he couldnt make it on his own but that was just the time when you came through to show how much you loved him and you wanted him to know that you would never leave and you would never go and you taught him to forgive and gave peace to his soul and now he truly lives cause you made him whole from that day ever since he aint never been alone thats why hed convinced he dont have to cry no more cry no more you dont have to cry

his way to the spot a man from upstairs told him to stop and come here and he just stared at this little boy of seven years with brown hair and as he came near the man whispered in his ear what he said left him numb frozen with fear he wanted to run but his feet wouldnt go anywhere he wanted to scream but he couldnt he was glued there he wanted to leave but he wouldnt he was too scared cry no

the pain as he got older but he was consumed with hate now for this neighbor and everyday he was ashamed when he saw himself so ashamed that he proclaimed that he would never tell blocked out the

would never speak he held it all inside until he turned fifteen i know that might be hard for you to believe but he couldnt talk about it until god set me free see way back when he was seven years old he was sexually abused but no one was ever told with nowhere to turn and no place to go see he thought he could get through and maintain control but little did he know he couldnt make it on his own but that was just the time when you came through to show how much you loved him and you wanted him to know that you would never leave and you would never go and you taught him to forgive and gave peace to his soul and now he truly lives cause you made him whole from that day ever since he aint never been alone thats why hed convinced he dont have to cry no more cry no more you dont have to cry

lives kids with tears in their eyes they now come up to me showing love to me and telling me that they look up to me the effects to me well its really kinda strange to see i only wanted to share with you now what jesus done for me but theres a whole nother side to things now that i come to see its a huge influence you got upon on the industry but enough of me cause its not what i came to say to you not a day goes by where i dont take time to pray for you im sorry now for what your mom and dad they did to you but i can relate with you cause well see dude ive been there too i know theres a lot of pain and hurt now that youve been through but never forget theres a real love god gave to you la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la to whom it may concern la la la la la la la la la la

and put it in your hands maybe you never listen to it or maybe you lost it or maybe you heard it and you just got mad and then you tossed it did he diss you back thats the question i always get and im like well god forbid that you might even have liked it i dont know but congratulations on your movie yo and heard your last record well its over ten million sold but theres one thing thats really got me thinking bro does a grammy mean anything if its just gotta cost your soul in case you didnt know theres a love that will never go away you say youre going to hell but it dont have to be that way see the bottom line of what im trying to say is god puts back together the broken pieces that are were thrown away if even everyone you know just up and goes away hell still love you till the very day that youre old and gray too bad a lot of christians all they do is hate on you instead of dropping to their knees and taking time to pray for you and its obvious that you really love your daughter dude and for that i gotta tell you well i really got respect for you so here it is dear slim chapter part 2 another cat trying to make it just like you yo dear slim did you hear the junk that im going through kids sending me hate mail and telling me how im biting you telling me how they gonna beat me up and just kill me too but a lot of people they just seem to get my song confused see what i say to you i know it might even sound funny but i never came at you just to paint you has the enemy it wasnt about hating you or starting some controversy it wasnt about blaming you or trying to make some money i dont claim to know everything that youve experienced man i dont even know if you even ever be hearing this but i said it once and i still hold to this is that a life with out christ is still a life that is never fixed ill tell you this even if its a hard pill to swallow like it or not slim you will always be a role model do you know these kids were the ones they always follow what we say and how we live gives them a better tomorrow ive had my share of some plus man ive been rejected ive been chewed up spit out and cussed disrespected but if i die today and never sell another record

of the week outside was real hot he told his dad where he would be now and what not said he would go down by trees near the bus stop the clock read quarter to three and he just thought ill sneak around and play hide and seek in the back lot and on his way to the spot a man from upstairs told him to stop and come here and he just stared at this little boy of seven years with brown hair and as he came near the man whispered in his ear what he said left him numb frozen with fear he wanted to run but his feet wouldnt go anywhere he wanted to scream but he couldnt he was glued there he wanted to leave but he wouldnt he was too scared cry no more you dont have to cry no more dont cry no more you dont have to cry no more what happened that day left him changed forever a day he wished he could erase and never remember he tried to block out the pain as he got older but he was consumed with hate now for this neighbor and everyday he was ashamed when he saw himself so ashamed that he proclaimed that he would never tell blocked out the memory of the pain so hed never feel hed pretend to be okay and hide in his shell hed try to put a smile on his face like all was well but this child couldnt change what he really felt he blamed god for the cards that he was dealt his heart grew hard by the time he was twelve began to fall apart and his grades start to fail until the day he cried to god asking for his help he wanted to find and start a new life for himself he closed his eyes and into the arms of christ he fell cry no more you dont have to cry no more dont cry no more you dont have to cry no more everything you heard the boy would never speak he held it all inside until he turned fifteen i know that might be hard for you to believe but he couldnt talk about it until god set me free see way back when he was seven years old he was sexually abused but no one was ever told with nowhere to turn and no place to go see he thought he could get through and maintain control but little did he know he couldnt make it on his own but that was just the time when you came through to show how much you loved him and you wanted him to know that you would never leave and you would never go and you taught him to forgive and gave peace to his soul and now he truly lives cause you made him whole from that day ever since he aint never been alone thats why hed convinced he

see i only wanted to share with you now what jesus done for me but theres a whole nother side to things now that i come to see its a huge influence you got upon on the industry but enough of me cause its not what i came to say to you not a day goes by where i dont take time to pray for you im sorry now for what your mom and dad they did to you but i can relate with you cause well see dude ive been there too i know theres a lot of pain and hurt now that youve been through but never forget theres a real love god gave to you la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la to whom it may concern

walked up to you and talked to you and put it in your hands maybe you never listen to it or maybe you lost it or maybe you heard it and you just got mad and then you tossed it did he diss you back thats the question i always get and im like well god forbid that you might even have liked it i dont know but congratulations on your movie yo and heard your last record well its over ten million sold but theres one thing thats really got me thinking bro does a grammy mean anything if its just gotta cost your soul in case you didnt know theres a love that will never go away you say youre going to hell but it dont have to be that way see the bottom line of what im trying to say is god puts back together the broken pieces that are were thrown away if even everyone you know just up and goes away hell still love you till the very day that youre old and gray too bad a lot of christians all they do is hate on you instead of dropping to their knees and taking time to pray for you and its obvious that you really love your daughter dude and for that i gotta tell you well i really got respect for you so here it is dear slim chapter part 2 another cat trying to make it just like you yo dear slim

get my song confused see what i say to you i know it might even sound funny but i never came at you just to paint you has the enemy it wasnt about hating you or starting some controversy it wasnt about blaming you or trying to make some money i dont claim to know everything that youve experienced man i dont even know if you even ever be hearing this but i said it once and i still hold to this is that a life with out christ is still a life that is never fixed ill tell you this even if its a hard pill to swallow like it or not slim you will always be a role model do you know these kids were the ones they always follow what we say and how we live gives them a better tomorrow ive had my share of some plus man ive been rejected ive been chewed up spit out and cussed disrespected but if i

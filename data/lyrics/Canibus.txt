hip-hop hall of fame for two bars i kept hearing in my head over and over again it cost me everything im convinced now that more than the truth is at stake where people create language that pretends to communicate euphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes but its a byproduct of the ghetto music we make from an extroverted point of view i think its too late hip hop has never been the same since 88 since it became a lucrative profession theres a misconception that a movement in any direction is progression even though the potency of it lessens big money industries writing checks to suppress the question and nobody gives a fuck no more no one goes to the book store ever since the confluence of moores law but i stay in the lab like niels bohr and his son aage edward lorenz and leo szilard

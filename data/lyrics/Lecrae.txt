looking for truth who says you know we all in the same boat yeah christians and muslims everybody like that huh yow you lookin for truth oh ive got some answers man so good to be ah lets get into it lets go night and day i aint scared to say that we different they play the prostitute but they like to say they just intimate idols in their heart they cant seem to lose their grip on it see them walkin in the direction that king agrippa went our world is different like whitley and wayne man they say we look the same but we aint chasin the same thing it all boils down to they think everythings relative jesus might as well be a south american president very evident they say that jesus was heaven sent they lifestyle reflects they worship themselves instead of him they dont acknowledge the christ if they did they wouldnt worship themselves by the way that they live all these rappers say they got guns that spray off 16 ive got a luke 9 that can take all 16 thats the bible the one they quote but they dont care about the author they think hes a joke man some folks say all truth is relative it just depends on what you believe you know hey man aint no way to know for sure who god is or whats really true but that means you believe your own statement that theres no way to know whats really true youre saying that that statement is true youre killing yourself if whats true for you is true for you and whats true for me is true for me what if my truth says yours is a lie is it still true come on man i promise everybody is asking the same questions who am i what is my purpose and my direction you probably believe that you exist for no other reason than self-satisfaction hedonism and pleasing things lifes about you gettin yours and bein happy even if it means a divorce and switchin families your job your house your car your spouse its all for the glory of you else you out you go to school get your degrees and get a job so you can make a whole lot of gs cause lifes hard you never thought of livin to please a real god and thats the reason he made you see he gave you breath to breathe the chest to breathe it so you can taste and see hes the best believe it he made us for his glory and not for your own homie our god is holy you should repent and die slowly see theres this thing called secular humanism that says man is the source of all meaning and all purpose you know what im saying were just the result of a big cosmic explosion we dont really have a purpose or meaning so we just come up with our own purpose were the source of our meaning and our purpose but how can a man which is the product of chance a finite being be the source of purpose and meaning you cant were created with purpose man get with the creator yall man everybody got a problem with god and when you mention the christ then they really get to turning the knobs but some say they roll with christ cause some rappers made it seem like he was cool with all the sin in their life no but then some say how can god exist when all this evil stuff in the world keep persistin wrong question ask again how come god aint let you feel the wrath from sin what you thought last night deserved a first class flight to hell where god doesnt dwell you got that right but he bought back life on a cross that night christ died you aint know that it cost that price all of gods anger poured on his son then together through all of eternity now he was shunned praise god for the life that was won for us aint got a beef with god because the son was crushed hey look man some people say that god aint real cause they dont see how a good god can exist with all this evil in the world if god is real then he should stop all this evil cause hes all-powerful right what is evil though man its anything thats against god its anything morally bad or wrong its murder rape stealing lying cheating but if we want god to stop evil do we want him to stop it all or just a little bit of it if he stops us from doing evil things what about lying or what about our evil thoughts i mean where do you stop the murder level the lying level or the thinking level if we want him to stop evil we gotta be consistent we cant just pick and choose that means you and i would be eliminated right because we think evil stuff if thats true we should be eliminated but thanks be to god that jesus stepped in to save us from our sin

a building of beings being constructed christ is the cornerstone foundation build on another and yous a goner holmes she built on em supported by him conformed to him now shes a body of bodies who transform through him a temple that breathes we are the halls we are the floor board or more we are the walls manifold wisdom of god no longer a mystery the church is the pinnacle of our salvific history one flesh union homie the tri-union is glorified through our corporatized communion still the present reality is she was born a casualty though shes made alive shes affected by depravity once lived in sin and enslaved by her lust and folks catch her slippin and they turn away disgusted shes a work in progress christ is the head of her and he wash her clean with the words that he done said to her shes already pretty but shes really not dressed and sometimes she look silly but shes far from a mess yes please so dont be dissin cause jesus done paid grip an and if you didnt then should caller her misses im talking bout the church her name is ecclesia meaning the the assembly bows to the trinity no other divinity a body family and community she is all one but on earth you see her in congregational small ones a microcosm or a small scale example but yes it is the church even though its just a sample invisible spiritual physical visible not a brick temple never that simple this a not a building she is not bricks shes a world changer but aint bout getting rich perpetrating fakes cause a lot of folks to hate plus her hands get dirty and her feet get scraped and sometimes her body parts start acting outa place legs tryna be arms arms thinking they the face but shell never be replaced with a one man band or a small taliban with no body in command some dont get it so they hate they say shes on a paper chase they say shes really fake so they go start a ministry so they can do the work but they dont understand how jesus feel about his church and yeah they make disciples they got plenty conversions they take care of the widows and the orphans they be workin but none of them are churchin no church structure no elders and no discipline they dont have a conductor and they so they dont submit but quite a few of them baptize people how i pray that youd look at this thing from gods eyes take responsibility inside the whole council not just the area where you might have a mouthful who should people submit to who will conduct the discipline if excommunicated what body will they be missing then look at ephesians 4 where paul gets practical 1st timothy and titus if

depends on what you believe you know hey man aint no way to know for sure who god is or whats really true but that means you believe your own statement that theres no way to know whats really true youre saying that that statement is true youre killing yourself if whats true for you is true for you and whats true for me is true for me what if my truth says yours is a lie is it still true come on man i promise everybody is asking the same questions who am i what is my purpose and my direction you probably believe that you exist for no other reason than self-satisfaction hedonism and pleasing things lifes about you gettin yours and bein happy even if it means a divorce and switchin families your job your house your car your spouse its all for the glory of you else you out you go to school get your degrees and get a job so you can make a whole lot of gs cause lifes hard you never thought of livin to please a real god and thats the reason he made you see he gave you breath to breathe the chest to breathe it so you can taste and see hes the best believe it he made us for his glory and not for your own homie our god is holy you should repent and die slowly see theres this thing called secular humanism that says man is the source of all meaning and all purpose you know what im saying were just the result of a big cosmic explosion we dont really have a purpose or meaning so we just come up with our own purpose were the source of our meaning and our purpose but how can a man which is the product of chance a finite being be the source of purpose and meaning you cant were created with purpose man get with the creator yall man everybody got a problem with god and when you mention the christ then they really get to turning the knobs but some say they roll with christ cause some rappers made it seem like he was cool with all the sin in their life no but then some say how can god exist when all this evil stuff in the world keep persistin wrong question ask again how come god aint let you feel the wrath from sin what you thought last night deserved a first class flight to hell where god doesnt dwell you got that right but he bought back life on a cross that night christ died you aint know that it cost that price all of gods anger poured on his son then together through all of eternity now he was shunned praise god for the life that was won for us aint got a beef with god because the son was crushed hey look man some people say that god aint real cause they dont see how a good god can exist with all this evil in the world if god is real then he should stop all this evil cause hes all-powerful right what is evil though man its anything thats against god its anything morally bad or wrong its murder rape stealing lying cheating but if we want god to stop evil do we want him to stop it all or just a little bit of it if he stops us from doing evil things what about lying or what about our evil thoughts i mean where do you stop the murder level the lying level or the thinking level if we want him to stop evil we gotta be consistent we cant just pick and choose that means you and i would be eliminated right because we think evil stuff if thats true we should be eliminated but thanks be to god that jesus stepped in to save us from our sin christ died for all evilness repent turn to jesus man'}, {'name': 'Run', 'lyrics': 'and if anyone competes as an athlete

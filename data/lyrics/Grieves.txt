to wake up all alone to finally figure out my wants in the house of haunted love the past will keep me warned and explain me even if youre listening through the storm i found a purpose and if you heard this then sit it down pick its brain until it opens up and redirects the sound the conductor frozen thunder rumbling through the ground with a perfect little twist of that suited armor and crown you created built for denying it hiding the cuts and bruises due to the self-inflicted bone crushing anxiety im with you so understand that all of this within you has chiseled you a flower out of stone yeah you are not alone grab hold of yourself i know what its like to get blown away i know you that youve done your dirt and youve dug your graves and it feels like it wont be saved i say grab

dont know if im addicted to the feeling or the fact that i can make a little exit without thinking of it hell i guess im showing all the signs huh and redirecting to where alcohol defines fun and ill admit that ive been known to have a good time but promised that id never cross the line but never learned to draw it call it write it with a goal make it so the night train never gets to go im as

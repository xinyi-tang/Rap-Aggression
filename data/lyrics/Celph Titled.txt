fahrenheit 813 since 93 i been makin beats and writin rap sheets mischevious teenager with a creative outlet to release anger booty shake bass music i was into that poison clan 2 live crew thats what got me into rap loopin tracks with fast hi-hats and 808s 4-track machine with the high-speed cassette tape now keep in mind i was a fan - but as mcs we all are and very few of us become stars went from blastin magic mike to grabbin a mic tried to sound like spice 1 and not rappers delight from e-40 to ice cube the west coast had a lot to do with the type of beats id write to but still the juice crew was one of my faves never discriminated whether new york or la and around the mid-90s i became fascinated with the lord finesse style of slick rhymin the redmans the big ls the das efxs ras kass and chino xl type of records so guess what celph titled emerged bowling ball style runnin through pens author of murderous words and i was set to rip every verse i put down 17 years old and at rappin im pretty good now i could write a rhyme flip it up and write a next one i could write a rhyme flip it up and write a next one i could write a rhyme flip it up and write a next one right on the spot right on the spot -- sadat x im from a city that dont have much hip-hop roots so i felt compelled to form a hip-hop group see i was once on some go against the norm flow fast and write rhymes in complex forms it was kinda ill at the time cause really the only other choice was puffy and mase and them big willie club joints so i got my act together and eventually met two other mcs that rapped together we was all on that underground vibe cella dwellas kool keith tribe and organized i was kinda out of my mind a weird guy cut designs in my facial hair fucked around with beard dye it was me majik and dutch and we had a lotta fun thought we were smart named ourselves equilibrium and had a label called atomik with walkmen and kramtronix layin down cuts on it i stayed pollyin 24-7 and in 1997 started recording our first record then my phone rang didnt know who it was from some guy that called himself apathy the alien tongue heard i had production and i could rhyme too he was from the north and knew some jedi mind dudes plus he had a crew better than any squad couple months later they was callin me a demigod i started shoppin my demo aggressively landed on the desk of buds distribution nyc next thing you know i got a single on wax and a offer for a job in new york so my bag was packed now im 19 and a floridian in new york white cuban boy that says nigga and eats pork so you could call me foul but back then i didnt care i would do whatever to catch a listeners ear so i submerged myself in the local scene nuyorican wetlands tramps speed sobs that guy apathy hes from connecticut so we would link up and write songs to make records with the label i was messin with they was feelin it so then we had vinyl distribution at our fingertips this demigodz onslaught was in full motion 20 singles in 2000 with no promotion my name was everywhere for beats and for features but best believe i had a fuckload of non-believers masterminded an underground persona dirty mouth punchline wild animal down to bring the drama i made a lotta friends from boston to philly never thought this many heads would say theyre really feelin me so you gotta respect that and when vinnie paz asked me to join the army i was like bet that then jimmy iovines assistant insisted that me and apathy make a little visit for business the deal fell through but atlantic picked ap up we expanded the godz in la with more rappers then cage got smacked up i remember punchin him i remember pressin up his diss songs and trumpin him i remember havin him so scared chain smokin in the backroom at his show just cause i was there he was drugged up and panicked couldnt face me he was frantic snuck behind with a bottle and then he ran quick thats how a little man fights a giant cowardly lyin and god

i was kinda out of my mind a weird guy cut designs in my facial hair fucked around with beard dye it was me majik and dutch and we had a lotta fun thought we were smart named ourselves equilibrium and had a label called atomik with walkmen and kramtronix layin down cuts on it i stayed pollyin 24-7 and in 1997 started recording our first record then my phone rang didnt know who it was from some guy that called himself apathy the alien tongue heard i had production and i could rhyme too he was from the north and knew some jedi mind dudes plus he had a crew better than any squad couple months later they was callin me a demigod i started shoppin my demo aggressively landed on the desk of buds distribution nyc next thing you know i got a single on wax and a offer for a job in new york so my

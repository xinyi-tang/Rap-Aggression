it begins so it ends beauty is her gift and her beauty is her curse look between home and school she dont know which one is worse every nigga tryna hit it so she dont know what she worth when she gave it to her first he went around saying he hit it first now picture that now she bitter her daddy used to hit her yeah nigga had a temper used to get touched on by the babysitter all that shits still in her but we aint tripping we just walk on by wave when we say hi but whats inside made her use her bathroom breaks to go and cry we dont ask so she dont tell so she figures nobody cares teen years have us isolated thinking nobody there insecure about what to wear she hates the person thats in the mirror but as a teen all we seen was light skin with pretty hair teachers used to think that she was fast all cos of how she looked but jealousy dont stop just cos they grown youll learn that in no book her beauty was a burden on the inside she was still hurting never found herself and now she grown and still searching it was she had posters all on her wall of her favourite artists shed call her girl to pick her up when she want to go catch niggas down at the mall dont judge a book by its cover i say judge a book by the authour what no god is there if my father wanna go hit the club with his daughter daughter probably bout just as lost she aint got no chance just a victim of circumstance none of this shit was in the plans nah not still living at home with her moms not get knocked up by no slob niggas spend all day playing 2k aint thinking about no job they say girl getchu an athlete like

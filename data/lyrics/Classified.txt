years passed then she ran back into him and they reminisced on their pasts time changes everything they started talking started relating started dating then got naked started the love making love is love they rushed the club this boy has never danced in his life but for this girl hed cut a rug yeah things were good but sometimes that boy would get jealous he knew he was wrong but couldnt help it and he knew he was selfish or maybe insecure he knew she didnt like him at first so every time she talked to other guys he thought she was a flirt they fought a little fought a lot thought of breaking up but never would let the day finish until they were done making up every treasure worth something is lost and then recovered he aint perfect she aint perfect but theyre perfect for each other its love say your mine love me tonight say that you will say that you will ssaaayy i will love you i will love you all my life now its been seven years and going strong holding on to the life they made hasnt been all easy street relationships have a price to pay she had a nine to five job a real career for work and loved it till the boss tried to hit on her and have an affair with her she stopped it quick said no and that was it but then she never told her boy until weeks later and he flipped and he didnt know how to handle it but got through it eventually they could figure it out together but not a chance doing it separately this boy was no saint though made some bad choices there was this other girl who hung around his boys theyd flirt for enjoyment nothing serious it was kinda pointless but then they started talking on email like i had a great time last weekend and his girl saw the emails obviously she started freaking like are you cheating tell me if you are right now or im fuckin

say that you will ssaaayy i will love you i will love you all my life ive never loved someone like this before ive never felt something and been so sure oh i feel it in my fingertips i hoped for this i hoped for this sorry for the eagerness i run to this i run to this now this boy and girl are married they wake up together everyday lifes good but sometimes when it is you take it for granted they dont have too many problems picture perfect in many ways but nowadays he dont take her out for dancing and aint romantic she complains about little things like cant you keep this house clean he thinks she just complains cause shes got nothing else to complain about they dont fight too much but when they do they dont always work it out cause they know theyll wake up together in the same bed in the same house anyway theyre driving in awkward silence boy looking at her like why aint she talking why is she crying whats she thinking about is she happy is she doubting us but they both know nothings

'Step It Up', 'lyrics': 'nowadays everybodys always asking me yo class what can i do to make it in this music game man step 1 get your flow come out of your shell step 2 learn the game and study it well step 3 go for self not anyone else step 4 if you wanna be heard you gotta yell if you wanna make it in the music business i wrote a couple steps that you all could follow gather all around sit down and listen and when its time to go in kid go all out a lot of people be hitting me up trying to get into the game and mixing it up like i got a name and im living it up dont think im living it up but i guess im getting my cut step 1 always stay faithful and try to bring something new to the table the games tough and the world can be hateful prepare yourself cause that hate might break you look a label wont make you just starting off dont worry about sending in your demo shit nowadays aint nobody mail demos anyway gotta learn value every penny saved step 2 make your music timeless cause thatll live on after you gone in silence never run out of gas like driving a hybrid you in for the long haul so mind your mileage now to make a record takes real talent but after thats when you face a real challenge thats when you see whos got the heart and the valence and honestly its hard to find the right balance you follow me good now the record is done and the pressure is on and the lessons to come now we separate one from the rest of the bunch the test has begun the test has begun if you wanna make it in the music business yeah i wrote a couple steps that you all could follow ha gather all around sit down and listen uh and when its time to go in yeah kid go all out alright team lets huddle in it we gotta build our own buzz the hustle begins i know you write rhymes but can you draw crowds thats the key to success so dont get locked out you gotta draw hype everything is fair play hit the blog sites the streets and the airplay avoid the negativity any haters and low lifes and oh right get your live show tight step 3 always step up your performance nothing more important than doing shows and touring hit the open mics hit your local promoters who are putting on shows and need a couple local openers be the engineer and the manager and the record label and the janitor be a pro in this whole pro-cess the promoter the producer and you may progress step 4 and when the real works done you know what they say if you build it they will come the labels come calling but the tables have spun now you got the under hand you can take what you want you think selling records is gonna make you income what i make in sales i make in three shows and then some remember this anyone can sell your music but they cant sell your live show unless youre gonna do it you can take this for whatever its worth my word but theres no guarantees its gonna work for sure step 1 dont believe all the shit they say step 2 the industry is a shady place step 3 and everybody is out for self step 4 so if you wanna be heard you gotta yell its a game at times unrealistic but a game all the same somebody wins and somebody loses it all depends on whoever chooses to take it most seriously'}, {'name':

yo wait whats that ya the piano part bring it back ya ya thats it right there now let me loop that in the sampler piano piece caught my ear gimmie a sec nothin better than a piano loop let me get this perfect let me pitch it up a bit a little faster might be worth it ya ya ok 73 beats per minute it still dont loop right let me try it 74 and that should make it loop tight there we go now this sample bumpin hard soundin like mythotical fairytales or somethin dark its giving me ideas already the moods the melody oh shit im losin track wait the beat still needs developing alright i got my sample so now i need a drum kit let me try out this one kick ya thats somethin i can run with now i figure out a pattern like running plays and maddin let the kicks sit on the sample make magic like aladdin and now i need a snare so let me try this here nah its too dirty the kicks too clear it doesnt mix right so let me try this rim shot a little bit of hand clap to give it a touch of hiphop ok that kinda work ya i like that maybe add some cymbals nah fuck it dont need no high hat but maybe add a shake of somethin slick and smooth like sound loop that cut it and make it move right ok i need a joint yo pass that over just one puff just wanted to get something in my head you know take me somewhere else before i drop this back ya i drop the drum now listen how the drum sound its almost there but this aint done and i aint tryin to jump the gun now track is soundin ripe but i aint finished man this take time still adjustin levels and gotta filter out the baseline like just turn the highs way down

rearrange a bit add some things and take you to another place wit it music is moods dont matter how its produced dont matter what tool you use or the instruments that you choose nope its all about listen i can switch right quick from laid back to hype shit wit a drum roll crash and a tight kick bring back the piano switch between your two samples turn up the clap and piano shakers to the left channel ya its workin almost sound complete but i probably wont be using it jordan you want this beat ya i kinda like the way this beat is flowin out maybe later on ill write some shit and put it down and i know oh shit yo yo hold on hold on hold on let me get that back hold on hold on ya i kinda like the way this beat is flowin out maybe later on ill write some shit and put it down and i know that

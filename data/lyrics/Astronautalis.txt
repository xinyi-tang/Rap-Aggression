right along and ignores the banging gavel of the judges plea for order in the chaos of the room outside my cell there is an oak that grows through the fence line and towards the sun they built a barrier of barbs flush but against its bark and still its burls unfurl into branches strong the silver thorns that hem in my hole snare me here through sun and snow while barbs may scar they cannot stop the mighty oak burgeoning upward and out this figure made out the persistence thatd been made stopped by its daggered escape route once it finally stands tall the limbs will make the fence fall the slowest getaway car that the guard ever saw the warden scratches his bald patches raised his arms in the air and wondered how this happened despite his decades to prepare in this i found the faith youd see my sentence a mistake discharge me from this place and reinstate me in your grace the truth will set you free one day my father promised me but id never thought the truth would come this way quite honestly william holds his palm out proud upon the bible lays it down and solemnly swear against it that every word is true searching through the faceless crowd in the hallowed auditorium he sees that everyone is turned against him and his endless pursuit if youd have told me back then that the words from my pen wouldve branded me a paynim id have never changed a damn thing im sure its shocking to your ears that the treatise you revere would suffer such assessment at the stylus of a confrere but i am more than well aware of how you all were unprepared to stare into the sun as a

will find very rare and far beyond compare all is sincere and rather debonair so lets all gather around because off to a place you thought was unreal where people of the world do know how to chill everything remains cool and calm where you are and if you ask about crime they allll say hah they wouldnt even know what you mean cause its a different program yall know the routine where people work hard for a decent buck and you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck never wondering whether your house is all right so go leave your vcr on the porch overnight and as for the people they all stand proud senior citizens party with the hip-hop crowd you can hang at a jam till the break of dawn and leave without your bally shoes getting stepped on everyone walks around in their right mind and all because crack aint nothing but a hole in the wall so those who wish to live with glare and flair theres a place that this can be done and yo what i discovered may just only seem as something that you find in your wildest dream but on the real tip you will see im not playing what im saying is reality there is a place people live with joy that the next man cannot come along and destroy no one faces problems no one says sorry and war aint nothing but a game on atari this message also applies to other nations like africa for instance where theres starvation but if you come with me youre sure to see ethiopians can eat in red lobster for free and people that you saw before that were poor will never ever see the situation no more cause in this world everyones a millionaire are you sick

and rather debonair so lets all gather around because off to a place you thought was unreal where people of the world do know how to chill everything remains cool and calm where you are and if you ask about crime they allll say hah they wouldnt even know what you mean cause its a different program yall know the routine where people work hard for a decent buck and you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck never wondering whether your house is all right so go leave your vcr on the porch overnight and as for the people they all stand proud senior citizens party with the hip-hop crowd you can hang at a jam till the break of dawn and leave without your bally shoes getting stepped on everyone walks around in their right mind and all because crack aint nothing but a hole in the wall so those who wish to live with glare and flair theres a place that this can be done and yo what i discovered may just only seem as something that you find in your wildest dream but on the real tip you will see im not playing what im saying is reality there is a place people live with joy that the next man cannot come along and destroy no one faces problems no one says sorry and war aint nothing but a game on atari this message also applies to other nations like africa for instance where theres starvation but if you come with me youre sure to see ethiopians can eat in red lobster for free and people

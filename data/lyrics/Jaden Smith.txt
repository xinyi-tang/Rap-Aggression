sunset until it chased him where you goin never quite sure about his placement or where hes been in this pink world or why nothing ever made sense he knew that he had loved and had been loved but had no chronological order to place it so confusing all he knew was that he woke up everyday bleeding with amnesia and the case of new memories that he had tendencies to mistake for fiction shes so beautiful so everyday he journeyed to the mountain to recover his past in order to understand his future i cant remember all this she loves him but she eventually killed him pow pow pow pow now listen syre was a mischief with a vision but his most poetic trait was his wisdom where you goin his mind was as bright and as pink as the city that he lived in and the only kids that could live in this bliss were the outcasts the msfts why did you leave those were his companions even though they could never understand his struggles through these harsh lands he gave them the upper hand of his emotional tantrums syre--passion pain and desire just like my big bro what you didnt know is this young kids been in limbo since that gunshot wound on that hidden road lost broken invisible but when that light gets low hes invincible time so much so that he redefines inevitable so itll never go brace yourself it seems as though the sun wouldnt set at all instead of setting slow she lies to him and said shed never let him go youre a liar and as the legend goes syre lived forever on and never and forever alone syre syre we should never end this i love you a beautiful confusion im syre'}]},

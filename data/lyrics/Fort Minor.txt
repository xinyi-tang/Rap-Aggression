actually build a store let me tell you a story in the form of a dream i dont know why i have to tell it but i know what it means close your eyes just picture the scene as i paint it for you it was world war ii when this man named kenji woke up ken was not a soldier he was just a man with a family who owned a store in la that day he crawled out of bed like he always did bacon and eggs with wife and kids he lived on the second floor of a little store he ran he moved to la from japan they called him immigrant in japanese hed say he was called issei that meant first generation in the united states when everybody was afraid of the germans afraid of the japs but most of all afraid of a homeland attack and that morning when ken went out on the doormat his world went black cause right there front page news three weeks before 1942 pearl harbors been bombed and the japs are coming pictures of soldiers dying and running ken knew what it would lead to and just like he guessed the president said the evil japanese in our home country would be locked away they gave ken a couple of days to get his whole life packed in two bags just two bags he couldnt even pack his clothes and some folks didnt even have a suitcase to pack anything in so two trash bags is all they gave them and when the kids asked mom where are we going nobody even knew what to say to them ken didnt wanna lie he said the us is looking for spies so we have to live in a place called manzanar where a lot of japanese people are stop it dont look at the gunmen you dont wanna get the soldiers wondering if youre gonna run or not cause if you run then you might get shot other than that try not to think about it try not to worry bout it being so crowded cause someday well get out someday someday yeah soon as war broke out the fbi came and they just come through the house and you have to come all the japanese have to go they took mr ni the people couldnt understand why they had to take him because hes an innocent laborer so now theyre in a town with soldiers surrounding them every day every night looked down at them from watchtowers up on the wall ken couldnt really hate them at all they were just doing their job and he wasnt gonna make any problems he had a little garden vegetables and fruits that he gave to the troops in a basket his wife made but in the back of his mind he wanted his familys life saved prisoners of war in their own damn country what for and time passed in the prison town he wondered if hed live it down if and when they were free the only way out was joining the army and supposedly some men went out for the army signed on and ended up flying to japan with a bomb that fifteen kiloton blast put an end to the war pretty fast two cities were blown to bits the end of the war came quick and ken got out big hopes of a normal life with his kids and his wife but then they got back to the home and what they saw made him feel so alone these people had trashed every room smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors written on the walls and the floor japs not welcome anymore and kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside he looked at his wife without words to say she looked back at him wiping tears away and said someday well be okay someday now the names have been changed but the story is true my family was locked up back in 42 my family was there where it was dark and damp and they called it an internment camp it was pretty pretty bad oh were gonna stay til last then my husband died before they closed the camp'}, {'name': 'Red To

Mr. Hahn)', 'lyrics': 'you know me i used to get caught up in everyday life tryna make it through my day so i could sleep at night tryna figure out my way through the maze of rights and wrongs but like you used to say nothing feels like its really worth it forget perfect im trying not to be worthless since i last saw you ive been looking for a purpose well i met this kid who thought like i did he had a weird way of looking at it this is what he said slip out the back before they know you were there and at the worst youll see nobody cares cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down even heroes know when to be scared slip out the back before they know you were there and at the worst youll see nobody cares cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down even heroes know when to be scared now i dont remember where i met him or remember his name but he walked funny like he was just too big for his frame just over five foot but he weighed a buck fifty and what he said just seemed so right it stuck with me listen its like poker you can play your best but you got to know when to fold your cards and take a rest and know when to hold your cards and hold your breath and hope that nobody else is stacking the deck because i dont need to tell you that life isnt fair it doesnt care it arbitrarily cuts off your air and like you i want someone to say its okay but in the truest parts of our hearts everybodys afraid were just under appreciated and overwhelmed fighting so hard to hide our fear that were scaring ourselves you understand what im saying cause you always did but its different in the words of a cowardly kid who said slip out the back before they know you were there and at the worst youll see nobody cares cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down even heroes know when to be scared slip out the back before they know you were there at the worst youll see nobody cares cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down even heroes know when to be scared and im no hero you remember how i was you know all i ever did was worry feeling out of control to the point where everything was going end over end im spinning around in circles again this is where you come in all of this to explain to you why i had to separate myself away from yesterdays life please remember this isnt how i hoped it would be but i had to protect you from me thats why i slipped out the back before you knew i was there i know you felt unprepared but every single time i was around id just bring you down and i could tell that it was time to be scared thats why i slipped out the back before you knew i was there and i know the way i left wasnt fair i didnt want to be around just to bring you down im not a hero but dont think i didnt care'}]}]

psychotic pitbull its barking mad how i came from nothing now i control the water ways your barge is banned my mum gave birth south of the thames then i float down to this ghost town now i call my ends where a county starts and the city ends and i learned to be careful when youre picking friends between the few men we had to build a boat lie it low just to keep the dream afloat a lot of people thought that it was washed up hence the reason why they looked like theyve seen a ghost call me brook call me black beard or davy jones one captain that will send your whole navy home and i will never rest with my skeleton therefore its relevant youll never call me lazy bones so welcome to my ghost ship that has promised me the one day itll free my soul so when the tide comes in upon the beat you

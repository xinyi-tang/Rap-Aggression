'lyrics': 'back in the days we wished to be a star rap in the street bang the beat on a car swany d banged the hood so hard it would dent while dave and rob just invents a style so smooth and unique but then rob went to school daves on wall street with a suit and a tie rob has a book bag but deep in their hearts i knew they wished they had a chance to rap on the record heard on the radio i was making my second album and said yo no time to rehearse yo rob youre first to kick your text homeboy youre next this is rob first to rock the microphone to see all the chromosomes the dna structure will make you pucker up your lips and say boy hes a trip to africa people want to go and laugh at ya up you mighty race you can accomplish what you will cause i will kill the beat not the person cause i dont ill like that i just rap and attack it aint wack i love being black but youre scared cause society went boo dont judge me as one of the many but one of few that will do anything i have to do to open your mind because youre numb this is serious but i wont extract the fun so when i kick it like karate bite you like arare if you kiss your teeth theres beef i have a shotty thats home waiting theres no escaping bum dont you know the sum of the parts is equal to whole and if youve got heart check out the roughest part its part two dave its on you to kick the text homeboy youre next my rap is synonymous with perfection suckers try to play me then they run for protection think about it when it comes to the rhyming originality that with all the great timing cause rapping with authority is the style that i am using so when youre at a party and you get to choosing the best i mean compared to the rest for style and class there is no contest im not offended or pretending im just lending a bit of my rhyme and then i am sending a musical note to whom it may concern you wanna battle me then youll have to get burned cause ill meet you beat you over again send you to the bar for a heineken and then youll come back for a rematch or some haps until we kick it ill say a fresh rhyme of course youll vick it then ill have to just beat you again ill have to slay you burn broil fry and saute you cause taking out a punk like you is pure fun ill stick you with a fork when i think youre done so savor cause i will not do you any favors and all these suckers out there just flava flav imitators yeah yall no time to fall im gonna go to the top but i wont crawl gonna jump and leap not walk im gonna run my pops is forty-five and im a son of a gun its chubb rock if you was wondering who its a collaboration merely of the two with rob and dave they both had a page we was all down back in the days doug martin gary johnny stan jamey danny tony ezra and derrick joe russell kurt louis roddle gene malcolm sean fisher and donald and the others that lived on troy this record goes out to my homeboy donny battle'}, {'name': 'Ya Bad Chubbs (with Hitman Howie Tee)', 'lyrics': 'this is an introduction to music that just be pumpin while hits just be dippin the intention is for humpin the floor shinin the wood with our jeans if its denim dont worry its hip hop dont hem em money earnin concernin ill be teachin and learnin gettin hot from my rhymes and my looks not from bourbon no solution no remedy no cure like a deodorant yo you have to be sure that if you talk up or walk up into myface that wouldnt become a big public disgrace cause ill ban you burn you up and tan you treat you like the elephant and man you will be hocked and locked in a jar with a lid hangin on a wall in michael jacksons crib cause im bad in fact im a thriller i drink milk thats why im a top biller like a funeral home ill make a killing im not giz even though im still chillin guys say that im scary girls say that im cuddly rough like bark but dark and lovely this aint no game and im no toy and like anita baker ill bring you joy with my word when i open my mouth ask oliver north to go and break south a homo is a no-no but you know ill smack a faggot boy you got to see me im rich like jimmy swaggart im a loon and ya know comin soon a rhyme kicked to this popeye tune this is hip hop with a little be-bop and i wont flop cause i cant stop i will mop up the slop and then go to the top i am not robocop im chubb rock im chubb rock risin and ill break your leg and im more than a forty ounce im more like a keg and im the big dipper rippin like jack the ripper and if you want the proof the proof is in my liquor so you knew it and you blew it lets get to it gonna run you over with a rhyme thats like a big buick and since you think youre slender ill slap you with a fender and bind you up wind you up and grind you up in a blender and then ill serve you with coffee and cake oh damn i shouldve had a v-8 oh well ill put you on a plate so it looks a little neater youre a tramp so ill sprinkle salt and pepper and paprika on your face like mace so you can taste immediately just like the base that went up your nose previously so it seems youre too zooed to battle what up chump acne bump skidaddle youre a nine im a ten victory is mine again this buds for me so here take a heineken with your self-esteem you will never redeem like martin luther king you have a dream that maybe you will beat me maybe defeat me but youre too illiterate so i wont consider it weak is the word and the rhyme is identical this is not the late show and im not arsenio hall but quite tall with the gall and i have magic and i can play ball and guys wont boo this girls will jsut screw this its ludicrous but we can do this cause youre new to this brutus im so smooth that im the smoothest im not handsome but i am the cutest you ever had thats why im so glad that im so good im bad'}]}]

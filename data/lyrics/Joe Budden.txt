questions more answers more ci smoke and more cancer more arguing more resistance its seems like the closer we get its more distance more angles a million different looks was on the same page just in different books theres so much i want to say but i got no ground cause we aint break up more like broke down now thats pain and torture add that with restraining orders then add the soul of my slain daughter none of this is how we planned it to be one big insanity plea shit could never end amicably i miss you trying you probably think i dont try too when you stubborn and prideful not much is insightful but god was trying to show me something he aint think that i knew sometimes shit that doesnt breathe can die too were we just dreamerz waiting for our shot to shoot to the moon were we just dreamerz spending our lives trying to see this thing through waiting to fly away waiting to fly away waiting to fly away waiting to fly away how we go from thoughts of marriage thoughts of me copping karats talks of what wed name her while shopping for a carriage but when the dream stopped who knew youd see me like a savage that you dreamt of vacations but only woke up with baggage all you ever did was love me and look at where it got you and when you wanted more all i did was say im not you im selfish not selfless and i say that with love so in essence youre asking for what im incapable of so now i find im going over choices i aint even made yet were we clouded by good times or great sex running fast towards an unknown fate that altered when i introduced you to my unknown traits in your dreams seems you had me pegged as another man but in mine only you would understand in our minds we were perfect we witnessed our dream get murdered now reality is on trial and we both awaiting the verdict but youll always be close to me though you said this aint how its supposed to be what we had was so real but you said i dont care never thought this day would come you said you gave your all and was left with none but we can both be spared but you dont think thats fair thats fair you cant see how you ever began to like a liar you lost track of all the little things that i admired but when the peace left i knew we might retire thinking man i live upstairs im something like somaya got memories but at what point are they lost you say we could work through it at what point is it forced we shoulda never rushed cause its like now we at a point where you wont never trust and for me i cant believe thats all we ever was the highs gone need a better buzz cause we sleep in the same bed but we never touch my solution to every beef is to revisit though well have the same emotions we wont be so livid wont be so vivid i think your girl secretly applauded our drama we dont need those critics we owe it to go over our foundation with a keen eye sad part to say you never have the same dream twice we let love and all its possibility take us from reality made it hard to see that we were bound together just to cover up the pain im wishing the skies were rain and wipe all my thoughts away cause im tired of dreaming'}, {'name': 'Time Flies', 'lyrics': 'look how life life has changed movin up

to the bone oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i mean we started with love then we ended with hatred the whole world in our business clearly nothing was sacred i know you down to your core unless for years you just faked it i know all of your flaws see your soul when you naked now you got a new squad all them bitches is basic and even if they aint it aint hard to mistake it i think you running from love with me you gotta face it are you guarding your heart from a nigga that always breaks it now you live in the club maybe you tryna stay busy you still call me every birthday to say that you miss me you check to see who im with did anybody come after but still talk like you the one you say that none of them matter i guess it is what it is what about what it could be do we try this again just to confirm what it should be but she said that she deserves much better for as long as she fought i guess our bond wasnt as strong as i thought well never know come on were broke like skeletons loving to the bone our hearts so delicate from hanging on too long nothing left to hide nothing left to show were broke like skeletons loving to the bone oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh im the one you hide the one you cant forget and youre the reason why i lie awake in bed you never felt so open i never been so scared to death we pushed so hard til there was nothing left under my skin gave what i had to

thats when i got the kaylin text read it and cried couldnt believe what she was saying next she said youre going through a lot im hoping you aint in the grave and dead cause not too many people know

was writing a note didnt get far as soon as i wrote down mom i just stopped couldnt lie to her couldnt figure out how to say bye to her couldnt explain the why to her couldnt picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her and shortly after that my pastor called which at first i kinda thought it was weird but that convo preserved me bout gods grace and mercy he aint even say goodbye he said let us pray and then he went into a prayer gripped the phone closed my eyes just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour all my thoughts are corrupt this shit is whack if everybody calls you a duck will you just quack guess a part of me really gives a fuck

was going off no sleep eyes red that night while you was drunk texting me i hope i read that right you was beefing bout giselle beefing bout alexa suddenly you was jealous mustve thought that i had sexed her i was laughing thought it was funny giselles the homie alexas twenty with hip withdrawals nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all i wouldnt dick her at all im guessing maybe you were insecure and never knew me was there for four months yet you said this was a new me in your head guess the answer to this jealousy was to turn around and try to make me jealous b but the part that you neglect was never mind jealousy this was bout respect yall instagramming pictures trying to get me upset you turned that into a night we both would never forget we both said some things we both probably regret you was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool only picked you up to try and talk sense into you now im fucking homeboy up just off the principle i guess he caught him self antagonizing me but hes a young nigga thats no surprising me shit i done fucked some of the baddest hoes i left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho i guess the part where i lose is now they got my face plastered all over the news im being falsely accused and i dont understand was this all part of a plan i guess ill tell the whole truth when on the stand how you go and tell the cops i had guns in my house now they got a search warrant just to come to my house question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid and you know jersey gun laws im talking hollow tips so you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want but you and i know whats going on nigga that whole night just replays in my mind your face is fine this is a big waste of time lets get back to that jealousy now you got a nigga facing three felonies all for what cause we were no longer dealing you attack me but im the villain over a fucking iphone and feelings check you never see me act like a jerk i know women will provoke you and get mad when it works rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst cause i go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait so now the whole world is watching me get burned here which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders anytime theres a pole in the bar centered so even though its from afar now i still wish you the best i know your hearts tender im sorry all i just got my own scars to tend to signing off truly yours with love gods sinner my every thought is scary and it makes

ive been misled missing you keeps messing with my head but when im alone i kind of freak out knowing what the big deal is about - ill step into the story where anything goes its always been this way i

my last mistake still im gonna take - a chance and try to find another girl like you and i want her to be a little kinder too i just want her to be - a little less like you i must admit that ive been

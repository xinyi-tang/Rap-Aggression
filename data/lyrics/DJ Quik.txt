be wicked cause when i was thirteen you know we didnt have cars it was either double ride the peg nuts or hop on the handle bars and then we went and bought a gang of balloons and had a water balloon fight that lasted until the night then after that we played some hide and go get it with the neighborhood homegirls dumb enough to be with it all in fun and games and keeping it cool but my my when youre kicking it time flies by cause every hours a minute and every minutes a sec and if id came home late my moms would ring my neck yeah but i regret not them whoopings i got cause to be able to play the next day was okay on a mission to hit up the neighbors fruit trees just a bunch of kids chillin enjoying the summer breeze summer breeze flowing like the wind boy you need to know that you got a friend and ill always be here ill always be here now im growing some fuzz getting older like 17 or 18 and the only thing i know is to stay clean t-shirt short pants nikes on spotless i was even old enough to buy me a cutlass or a vehicle to ride around town flirt with the hoes and roll down the window and mack to the one whos chosen yo them biker pants look kinda right on you my name is dj quik and my homies is having a barbeque before i finish my whole sentence complete yo she was off the bus stop and in my passenger seat and we was sliding to the westside stopped at the store to get some boones farm because that make em kick it a little more and at the spot you know that chicken was kicking the pig on the grill and so the day was chill but that night my girl was tipsy and was ready to skeeze but i didnt even trip too busy jocking the summer breeze now im 23 and i remember the times when we was chillin like villians and didnt have no nines like when we used to mob to beaches to kick it and swim now i hang around and watch the tides come in and im thinking how many funerals ive been to watching all my homies get buried in them boxes they put em into and then i read a letter from upstate from my homie g-wayne whos been locked up since 87 88 and it really aint nothing fly about it so either imma stay strong or break down and simply cry about it and when it seem like things just aint gon be right i gotta thank my creator for letting me sleep last night and waking me up in the morning because i shudder to think that that could be me dead or locked away in the clink so im lifting my homies spirits as tall as the trees and i can even hear him calling me in the summer breeze'}, {'name': 'Jus Lyke Compton', 'lyrics': 'finally out the muthafuckin cpt off to

kickin up sand to them bangin aint nothin new and slangin aint nothin new and for every nigga we done shot they done shot two straight doin locs since the sixties before i was born families of young

couple of bitches then they took us to a man named gus in a store he put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore thats when i started thinking that this wasnt like home but then they had to prove me wrong cause later that night after we did the show we went back to the afterset and wouldnt ya know yeah bloods and crips start scrappin and shootin -- in missouri damn how could this happen now st louis ha ha ha is just like compton yeah yall st louis ha ha ha ha is just like compton nigga i dont think they know they too crazy for their own good they need to stop watchin that colors and boyz n

red and blue sweatsuits when im thinkin bout horse dookie and cowboy boots i guess texas aint no different from the rest and san antonio was just waitin to put us to the test and before it was over

trip too busy jocking the summer breeze now im 23 and i remember the times when we was chillin like villians and didnt have no nines like when we used to mob to beaches to kick it and swim now i hang around and watch the tides come in and im thinking how many funerals ive been to watching all my homies get buried in them boxes they put em into and then i read a letter from upstate from my homie g-wayne whos been locked up since 87 88 and it really aint nothing fly about it so either imma stay strong or break down and simply cry about it and when it seem like things just aint gon be right i gotta thank my creator for letting me sleep last night and waking me up in the morning because i shudder to think that that could be me dead or locked away in the clink so im lifting my homies spirits

gettin drunk and off that bud i was doing the shit they hadnt heard of but foolish was i to think that it wasnt no other cities like this and they didnt like this that compton was the home of a foot in yo ass where you got blast and now thats just a thing of the past let me tell ya why firsthand we did a show up in oak-land and niggas was kickin up sand to them bangin aint nothin new and slangin aint nothin new and for every nigga we done shot they done shot two straight doin locs since the sixties before i was born families of young niggas mourn so im just letting you know that if ya plan to take a trip to the bay keep your hand on your clip because oakland ha ha ha is just like compton yeah im telling yall oakland ha ha ha is just like compton fool moving on to st louis where they country as fuck with gold teeth in they mouth but they still know whats up where its hot as a muthafucka hot enough to make ya cuss thats why i kept my ass on the bus but later on when it cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends who put us up on the st louis cap the smith center with big bob little steve tojo biss and rich and a couple of bitches then they took us to a man named gus in a store he put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore thats when i started thinking that this wasnt like home but then they had to prove me wrong cause later that night after we did the show we went back to the afterset and wouldnt ya know yeah bloods and crips start scrappin and shootin -- in missouri damn how could this happen now st louis ha ha ha is just like compton yeah yall st louis ha ha ha ha is just like compton nigga i dont think they know they too crazy for their own good they need to stop watchin that colors and boyz n the hood too busy claimin sixties tryin to be raw and never ever seen the shaw but now back to the story that im tellin we packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin when we arrived i saw red and blue sweatsuits when im thinkin bout horse dookie and cowboy boots i guess texas aint no different from the rest and san antonio was just waitin to put us to the test and before it was over the shit got deep a nigga got shot in the face and was dead in the street then they came in the club thinkin of scrappin little did they know that we was packin yeah we was puttin em down and scaring the rest shit i even had to wear the bulletproof vest now san antonio ha ha ha ha is just like compton yeah san antonio ha ha ha ha is just like compton bitch after about a month on the road we came home and i can safely say that la is a much better place to stay how could a bunch of niggas in a town like this have such a big influence on niggas so far away but still my story aint over cause i got one more to tell and the people of colorado they know it well it was all in the news and if you dont remember i had this show i did in denver with a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink bitches was lovin it but niggas was shovin and shit to the front of the stage to throw their gang signs but im getting paid so i didnt pay it no mind then i poured out my brew onto their face and chest then they start throwin soda and fuckin up my guess

let me tell a little story about the places that i been to and the shit that i been through like fightin and shootouts and bangin and shit all because a nigga made a hit check it 1991 it was double or nothing not a nigga wit hit then we broke out with the fonky shit about bitches and niggas and gettin drunk and off that bud i was doing the shit they hadnt heard of but foolish was i to think that it wasnt no other cities like this and they didnt like this that compton was the home of a foot in yo ass where you got blast and now thats just a thing of the past let me tell ya why firsthand we did a show up in oak-land and niggas was kickin up sand to them bangin aint nothin new and slangin aint nothin new and for every nigga we done shot they done shot two straight doin locs since the sixties before i was born families of young niggas mourn so im just letting you know that if ya plan to take a trip to the bay keep your hand on your clip because oakland ha ha ha is just like compton yeah im telling yall oakland ha ha ha is just like compton fool moving on to st louis where they country as fuck with gold teeth in they mouth but they still know whats up where its hot as a muthafucka hot enough to make ya cuss thats why i kept my ass on the bus but later on when it cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends who put us up on the st louis cap the smith center with big bob little steve tojo biss and rich and a couple of bitches then they took us to a man named gus in a store he put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore thats when i started thinking that this wasnt like home but then they had to prove me wrong cause later that night after we did the show we went back to the afterset and wouldnt ya know yeah bloods and crips start scrappin and shootin -- in missouri damn how could this happen now st louis ha ha ha is just like compton yeah yall st louis ha ha ha ha is just like compton nigga i dont think they know they too crazy for their own good they

through the sand in the sands of time until we paint the end of this love scene until im laid to rest in your blood stream until i hear the strings of your heart playing until i hear the things you

loving you is god and because of all of our darkness--which at night i still run from which at night we all still run from we get stuck chasing light thats a black synagogue and god said that the meek shall inhabit the earth but there shall be masses i said masses of bloodshed first and that will open the floodgates of heaven and pour down upon us his blessings from the floor to the ceiling but only if you praise him i said praise him shall you receive his healing save me from the pain im falling down dont you hear me calling i need you now fill me til im whole with your holy light give me sanction can you bring me back to life i been running from the pain in my brain got stains on my scene while i search for the real me search for the real me lost in the night only talk to angels when im lost in a height i dont really wanna get lost in my mind so i pray until i feel im getting lost in the vibe then i took the bottle up and i drink it to my what yep drink it to my fucking souls lost in my eyes but i dont really wanna drown no cuz im not that trusting but ima keep coming round though till im sure that i found something and when i tell you what it is you better talk to god remember no feelings no thoughts allowed and if pains a trapdoor then i need god and so send someone to come walk me out but dont think dont talk about it wait dont sing dont tell nobody wait dont drink dont fail your body wait dont scream no fucking shout it see these voices in my head are the fucking loudest so belligerent so fucking rowdy and my tunnel visions so fucking clouded and i dont really have a motherfucking outlet so i talk to god but i dont really know if he can hear me but you know him well and i think that you could bring him near me so i keep praying every word that i keep saying every part of me that i needed shield from every part of me that needs saving none of thiss real when it calls you thought i found you now im lost too ive been listening to service sermons a lotta redefining a lot of words reworded a lotta thoughts detected and thoughts suggested a lotta stuff that resonates with certain persons ive been searching for the truth but its embedded in lies read every single verse until im red in my eyes and godll only hear you when you offering ties and protection is the truth but when the devils a lie but what am i to do when the devil is i and everything i touch seems to shrivel and die my mama always said i was a rebel inside but now im looking for some peace and a benevolent i and how it feels to need that some humbling pie and how long it will take when it comes from the sky means ill probably be waiting until i crumble and die and just wrestling with satan while im struggling by so i think i talk about it wait i drink i tell somebody wait i sink i fail my body wait i scream im fucking shouting cause these voices in my head are the fucking loudest so belligerent so fucking rowdy and my tunnel visions so fucking clouded and i dont really have a motherfucking outlet so i talk to god but i dont really know if he can hear me and you know him well and i think that you could bring him near me so i keep praying everything that i keep saying every part of me that i needed shield from every part of me that needs saving did he die on the cross for this do you have any fucking proof everything here is man-made and im just searching for some fucking truth cause everything they ever told me not to do has always made me question what freedom is why listen to the words when they not from you and why feel judged when i freely live now i know what the fucking root of evil is and why peace is dead but evil lives everybody thinking they can talk to you and what they believe in they hearts are true now they feel that they had the right to persecute judge doom to hell and come first to you now i dont really know who wrote the bible but nothing under the sun goes unrecycled take every shot you have with a fucking rifle cause you rarely ever get a chance for revival so just think just talk about it wait just think just tell somebody wait dont blink dont fail your body wait just scream just fucking shout it so the voices in your head fall abruptly silent and the blood in your veins flows rough and violent and you see everything with your lifted eyelids and every burden you carry is eventually lighted and you talk to god even when you aint sure he hears you and you give it to him tell him he can keep the pain and fears too and you keep praying only now you dont repeat sayings cuz you know when you let it go then you receive savin how many people here look for jesus to solve their problems lots of people and how many of those people are fixed none of them know fucking about shit theyre all fucking fucked up anything to help you escape it takes it it takes something to just say fuck it this is reality im gonna deal with it but do we ever really deal with it deal with it stop running stop trying to find these

took into account the things that you were hiding i even understood your rage when i see you get violent i guess the height of all my envy was leaving me blinded until you sat me down and told me how

didnt make me less average but how i use it to my advantage determined my passion it took some time to understand and manage but then i learned this passion was the method to my madness and i never got to thank you at least not in the way i planned but i had to learn before i did that i hope you understand it takes a lot for me to bury hatchets but consider them cremated all the ashes burned to ashes and im dusting off my vocal box and finally saying thank you and even though you aint my fan you did the shit they aint do so disregard my temper and the times i fucking hate you because despite all my ignorance im really fucking grateful never forget the importance of the spot you hold took a glance towards the mirror now i know that everything changes i used to hate me i swore my life was too painful let my demons overtake me before i fight with my angels there was constantly a struggle to see my life at an angle that provided understanding of how much drama could change you i used to cut myself open just to feel like i was living but when living is just dying then theres no longer a difference theres no longer existence and theres no longer persistence and theres no longer a drive there existing on only division and i thought if nobody ever loved me this vacancy inside me must be really called a bloodstream then i looked into the world and saw a million people like me probably

and blue chasing clouds and hoping they lead a trail to you see we were deep sea divers and i was focused on survival and death does you part when youre focused on its rival defibrillator love im just focused on revival you could you could put your hands in mine and well walk through the sand in the sands of time until we paint the end of this love scene until im laid to rest in your blood stream until i hear the strings of your heart playing until i hear the things you are not saying until i find out what it really means and hopefully its everything it really seems breaking me open again oh

light can make everything feel beautiful it can make it feel safe so safe that like in the night we spend all of our time running away from our truths and then we meet someone who tells us god will always love you no matter what you do the only thing that will never stop loving you is god and because of all of our darkness--which at night i still run from which at night we all still run from we get stuck chasing light thats a black synagogue and god said that the meek shall inhabit the earth but there shall be masses i said masses of bloodshed first and that will open the floodgates of heaven and pour down upon us his blessings from the floor to the ceiling but only if you praise him i said praise him shall you receive his healing save me from the pain im falling down dont you hear me calling i need you now fill me til im whole with your holy light give me sanction can you bring me back to life i been running from the pain in my brain got stains on my scene while i search for the real me search for the real me lost in the night only talk to angels when im lost in a height i dont really wanna get lost in my mind so i pray until i feel im getting lost in the vibe then i took the bottle up and i drink it to my what yep drink it to my fucking souls lost in my eyes but i dont really wanna drown no cuz im not that trusting but ima keep coming round though till im sure that i found something and when i tell you what it is you better talk to god remember no feelings no thoughts allowed and if pains a trapdoor then i need god and so send someone to come walk me out but dont think dont talk about it wait dont sing dont tell nobody wait dont drink dont fail your body wait dont scream no fucking shout it see these voices in my head are the fucking loudest so belligerent so fucking rowdy and my tunnel visions so fucking clouded and i dont really have a motherfucking outlet so i talk to god but i dont really know if he can hear me but you know him well and i think that you could bring him near me so i keep praying every word that i keep saying every part of me that i needed shield from every part of me that needs saving none of thiss real when it calls you thought i found you now im lost too ive been listening to service sermons a lotta redefining a lot of words reworded a lotta thoughts detected and thoughts suggested a lotta stuff that resonates with certain persons ive been searching for the truth but its embedded in lies read every single verse until im red in my eyes and godll only hear you when you offering ties and protection is the truth but when the devils a lie but what am i to do when the devil is i and everything i touch seems to shrivel and die my mama always said i was a rebel inside but now im looking for some peace and a benevolent i and how it feels to need that some humbling pie and how long it will take when it comes from the sky means ill probably be waiting until i crumble and die and just wrestling with satan while im struggling by so i think i talk about it wait i drink i tell somebody wait i sink i fail my body wait i scream im fucking shouting cause these voices in my head are the fucking loudest so belligerent so fucking rowdy and my tunnel visions so fucking clouded and i dont really have a motherfucking outlet so i talk to god but i dont really know if he can hear me and you know him well and i think that you could bring him near me so i keep praying everything that i keep saying every part of me that i needed shield from every part of me that needs saving did he die on the cross for this do you have any fucking proof everything here is man-made and im just searching for some fucking truth cause everything they ever told me not to do has always made me question what freedom is why listen to the words when they not from you and why feel judged when i freely live now i know what the fucking root of evil is and why peace is dead but evil lives everybody thinking they can talk to you and what they believe in they hearts are true now they feel that they had the right to persecute judge doom to hell and come first to you now i dont really know who wrote the bible but nothing under the sun goes unrecycled take every shot you have with a fucking rifle cause you rarely ever get a chance for revival so just think just talk about it wait just think just tell somebody wait dont blink dont fail your body wait just scream just fucking shout it so the voices in your head fall abruptly silent and the blood in your veins flows rough and violent and you see everything with your lifted eyelids and every burden you carry is eventually lighted and you talk to god even when you aint sure he hears you and you give it to him tell him he can keep the pain and fears too and you keep praying only now you dont repeat sayings cuz you know when you let it go then you receive savin how many people here look for jesus to solve their problems lots of people and how many of those people are fixed none of them know fucking about shit theyre all fucking fucked up anything to help you escape it takes it it takes something to just say fuck it this is reality im gonna deal with it but do

wanted to be you and i just hope my desire to wasnt that see through i never took into account the things that you were hiding i even understood your rage when i see you get violent i guess the height of all my envy was leaving me blinded until you sat me down and told me how crazy your life is you said to run and never look back and if i did to never lose track of all the hurdles i was jumping that lead me to my current goal dont sell your soul baby you are dirty gold 3x took a chance said youd love me we both know that everything changes you found me when i was dying and unappreciated you broke me down into a science that i completely hated you told impeccable talent didnt make me less average but how i use it to my advantage determined my passion it took some time to understand and manage but then i learned this passion was the method to my madness and i never got to thank you at least not in the way i planned but i had to learn before i did that i hope you understand it takes a lot for me to bury hatchets but consider them cremated all the ashes burned to ashes and im dusting off my vocal box and finally saying thank you and even though you aint my fan you did the shit they aint do so disregard my temper and the times i fucking hate you because despite all my ignorance im really fucking grateful never forget the importance of the spot you hold took a glance towards the

angle that provided understanding of how much drama could change you i used to cut myself open just to feel like i was living but when living is just dying then theres no longer a difference theres no longer existence and theres no longer persistence and theres no longer a drive there existing on only division and i thought if nobody ever loved me this vacancy inside me must be really called a

when i told you i was going to kill you all when you were sleeping we were crazy but we had a lot of bad examples living how we were living thats a lot of shit to handle and every time we turned around it seemed like she was hurt again even when she promised us wed never have to hurt again and we never had a family but even with the hatred we have never not had we you should know that id be

but not the way we used to when the love that you know now is nothing you were used to sometimes you have to stop feeling sorry for yourself and love you that way you can teach anybody else and if its pain that you were feeling you release it till it stops or else it will get stronger and just beat you till you drop youre a lot smarter than youre ever given credit for live like a simile lessons are a metaphor i hope one day youre strong enough to break free from the cage and that everything inside you is the reason i be great and its you and me and everything we are is everything well be i swear

another man than himself but this man was confused this man was abused see this man was a tool to the sickness that he let loose infected and he abused molested and he abused till the person that he affected was lesser than finna shoes damn he affected the chance to choose he never gave him an option he told him what to believe but never gave him a doctrine now little boy blue hes just like you

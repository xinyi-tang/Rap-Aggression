back - home spoken now according to our text in 2 corinthians chapter 1 - we have the promise of god that he is a comforter in not just some but all of our afflictions yes and those of us who have experienced the abundant comfort through our relationship with christ are equip by the grace of god to assist in comforting this family and yes church we want to wrap our arms around them and serve them at this time of bereavement not just in word but indeed also now as i look over all of these young faces in this sanctuary there is no doubt you have been touched by the life of this young man and gripped by his death yes we are forced to hold our attention at death today - though in our generation life pleasures pursuits having big things and living big dreams are more appealing topics of conversation and thought but today we face with one undisputed absolute truth of our own mortality but in 2 corinthians chapter 1 verse 9 god gives us two reasons for us to face death and our powerlessness against it number 1 that we should not trust in ourselves and number 2 that we should trust in god who raises the dead now understand we are not victims of death but death according to james is the result of our sin and rebellion against god but we are not left without hope - for god sent his son jesus christ who took up all our sins and died on the cross and according to hebrews defeated death through his resurrection for all who would believe chris johnson has not died in vain there are some in this room who through the glory of christ this day will be redeemed thank -
